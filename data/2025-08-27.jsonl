To enable\nrapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated\npipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use\nexecution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration\ntraditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality,\nexecution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute\ngains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF,\nNYU CTF Bench, and Cybench.

However, integrating these technologies\npresents significant computational challenges, as light field displays require\nmultiple high-resolution renderings from slightly shifted viewpoints, while\nradiance fields rely on computationally intensive volume rendering. In this\npaper, we propose a unified and efficient framework for real-time radiance\nfield rendering on light field displays. Our method supports a wide range of\nradiance field representations, including NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting, and\nSparse Voxels, within a shared architecture based on a single-pass plane\nsweeping strategy and caching of shared, non-directional components. The\nframework generalizes across different scene formats without retraining, and\navoids redundant computation across views. We further demonstrate a real-time\ninteractive application on a Looking Glass display, achieving 200+ FPS at 512p\nacross 45 views, enabling seamless, immersive 3D interaction. On standard\nbenchmarks, our method achieves up to 22x speedup compared to independently\nrendering each view, while preserving image quality."}

We introduce PanoHair, a\nmodel that estimates head geometry as signed distance fields using knowledge\ndistillation from a pre-trained generative teacher model for head synthesis.\nOur approach enables the prediction of semantic segmentation masks and 3D\norientations specifically for the hair region of the estimated geometry. Our\nmethod is generative and can generate diverse hairstyles with latent space\nmanipulations. For real images, our approach involves an inversion process to\ninfer latent codes and produces visually appealing hair strands, offering a\nstreamlined alternative to complex multi-view data acquisition setups. Given\nthe latent code, PanoHair generates a clean manifold mesh for the hair region\nin under 5 seconds, along with semantic and orientation maps, marking a\nsignificant improvement over existing methods, as demonstrated in our\nexperiments."}

Accepted\n  by ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS)", "summary": "The proliferation of misinformation in journalism, often stemming from flawed\nreasoning and logical fallacies, poses significant challenges to public\nunderstanding and trust in news media. Traditional fact-checking methods, while\nvaluable, are insufficient for detecting the subtle logical inconsistencies\nthat can mislead readers within seemingly factual content. To address this gap,\nwe introduce Skeptik, a hybrid framework that integrates Large Language Models\n(LLMs) with heuristic approaches to analyze and annotate potential logical\nfallacies and reasoning errors in online news articles. Operating as a web\nbrowser extension, Skeptik automatically highlights sentences that may contain\nlogical fallacies, provides detailed explanations, and offers multi-layered\ninterventions to help readers critically assess the information presented. The\nsystem is designed to be extensible, accommodating a wide range of fallacy\ntypes and adapting to evolving misinformation tactics. Through comprehensive\ncase studies, quantitative analyses, usability experiments, and expert\nevaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Skeptik in enhancing readers'\ncritical examination of news content and promoting media literacy. Our\ncontributions include the development of an expandable classification system\nfor logical fallacies, the innovative integration of LLMs for real-time\nanalysis and annotation, and the creation of an interactive user interface that\nfosters user engagement and close reading. By emphasizing the logical integrity\nof textual content rather than relying solely on factual accuracy, Skeptik\noffers a comprehensive solution to combat potential misinformation in\njournalism. Ultimately, our framework aims to improve critical reading and\nprotect the public from deceptive information online and enhance the overall\ncredibility of news media."}

In\nthis work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly\ngenerates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for\ncausal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry\nestimation.

However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a\nchallenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities\npublished annually makes automated support desirable.\n  This paper introduces TRIAGE, a two-pronged automated approach that uses\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the ATT&CK\nknowledge base. We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE\nMapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques. This list is then\ncombined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context\nlearning to map a CVE to relevant techniques. This hybrid approach\nstrategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference. Our\nevaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping\nmethods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques. We\nalso find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task.\nOverall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the\nimpact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping\nCVEs to ATT&CK more efficient.\n  Keywords: vulnerability impact, CVE, ATT&CK techniques, large language\nmodels, automated mapping."}

While this sparsity improves\nefficiency, MoE still faces substantial challenges due to their massive\ncomputational scale and unpredictable activation patterns.\n  To enable efficient MoE deployment, we identify dual sparsity at the tensor\nand neuron levels in pre-trained MoE modules as a key factor for both accuracy\nand efficiency. Unlike prior work that increases tensor-level sparsity through\nfiner-grained expert design during pre-training, we introduce post-training\nexpert partitioning to induce such sparsity without retraining. This preserves\nthe mathematical consistency of model transformations and enhances both\nefficiency and accuracy in subsequent fine-tuning and inference.

DTInsight offers three key features: (a) an interactive\nconceptual architecture visualization of DTs; (b) generation of summaries of DT\ncharacteristics based on ontological data; and (c) integration of these outputs\ninto a reporting page within a continuous integration and continuous deployment\n(CI/CD) pipeline. Given a modeled description of the DT aligning to our DT\nDescription Framework (DTDF), DTInsight enables up-to-date and detailed reports\nfor enhanced stakeholder understanding."}

We know less about how accessibility is experienced\nand negotiated by disabled workers within these organizations. Through\ninterviews with 20 BLV workers across various tech companies, we uncover a\npersistent misalignment between organizational attempts at accessibility and\nthe current realities of these employees. We introduce the concept of the\naccessibility paradox, which we define as the inherent tension between the\nproductivity- and profit-driven nature of tech companies and their desire to\nhire and retain disabled workers. Focusing on the experiences of BLV workers,\nwe show how the accessibility paradox manifests in their everyday workplace\ninteractions, including digital infrastructure, accommodations processes and\npolicies, ability assumptions, and competing priorities. We offer\nrecommendations for future research and practice to understand and improve\nworkplace accessibility and inclusion."}

This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion\nfRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational\nevaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation\nof clinical dialogue agents.\n  MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical\nscenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through\nstructured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator\nfor detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert\nclinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of\nproducing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and\nbehavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference\nstudy.\n  Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable\nsafety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard\ndetection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded\nassessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realism\nanalyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably\nsimulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking\nfive LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios\nand 10 clinical domains.\n  MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with\nscalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned\nsafety auditing. We release all evaluation tools, prompts, structured\nscenarios, and datasets."}

However, most systems remain constrained by a linear\nrequest-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in\nmulti-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm\nin which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces\n(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework\nleverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative\nrefinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic\nevaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares\ngenerative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,\ninteraction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and\nemotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces\nconsistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in\nover 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative\ninterfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction."}
