However, little is\nknown about the sources of these datasets in terms of platforms and the RE\nactivities that were researched with the help of the respective datasets.\n[Aims] The goal of this paper is to investigate the state-of-the-art of the\ndatasets of mobile apps used in existing RE research. [Method] We carried out a\nsystematic mapping study by following the guidelines of Kitchenham et al.\n[Results] Based on 43 selected papers, we found that Google Play and Apple App\nStore provide the datasets for more than 90% of published research in RE for\nmobile apps. We also found that the most investigated RE activities - based on\ndatasets, are requirements elicitation and requirements analysis. [Conclusions]\nOur most important conclusions are: (1) there is a growth in the use of\ndatasets for RE research of mobile apps since 2012, (2) the RE knowledge for\nmobile apps might be skewed due to the overuse of Google Play and Apple App\nStore, (3) there are attempts to supplement reviews of apps from repositories\nwith other data sources, (4) there is a need to expand the alternative sources\nand experiments with complimentary use of multiple sources, if the community\nwants more generalizable results. Plus, it is expected to expand the research\non other RE activities, beyond elicitation and analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81eaGoogle Play\u548cApple App Store\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u6307\u51fa\u9700\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u6d3b\u52a8\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ed3\u679c\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u6e90\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u7814\u7a76\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Kitchenham\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6620\u5c04\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e8643\u7bc7\u76f8\u5173\u8bba\u6587\u3002", "result": "90%\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u81eaGoogle Play\u548cApple App Store\uff0c\u9700\u6c42\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u5206\u6790\u662f\u6700\u5e38\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u6d3b\u52a8\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u7ed3\u679c\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u5177\u666e\u9002\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u3002"}}
