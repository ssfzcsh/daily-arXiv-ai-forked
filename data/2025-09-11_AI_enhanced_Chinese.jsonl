Existing solutions often require additional context,\nexpensive SMT solvers, or manual intervention to approximate these functions\nthrough symbolic stubs. In this work, we propose a novel approach to\nautomatically generate symbolic stubs for external functions during symbolic\nexecution that leverages Genetic Programming. When the symbolic executor\nencounters an external function, AutoStub generates training data by executing\nthe function on randomly generated inputs and collecting the outputs.

Our method leverages a series of\ngraphs that capture critical information contained in the data, including\nwell-defined locations (for vertices) and Ricci curvature information (for\nedges). Our visualization approach then generates a curved surface (manifold)\nin which (a) geographical locations of vertices are maintained and (b) the\nRicci curvature values of the graph edges determine the curvature properties of\nthe manifold. The resulting manifold highlights areas of critical connectivity\nand defines an instance of \"Internet delay space\" where latency measurements\nmanifest as geodesics. We describe details of our method and its implementation\nin a tool, which we call Matisse, for generating, visualizing and manipulating\nmanifolds projected onto a base map.

A comparative framework is applied to relational, document,\nkey-value, column-family and graph databases to assess scalability,\nconsistency, query expressiveness, operational overhead and integration ease.\nEmpirical data drawn from industry case studies such as Netflix, Uber, and\nShopify, and survey data illustrate real-life adoption trends and challenges.\nThese findings demonstrate that polyglot persistence increases adaptability ,\nperformance , domain alignment but also governance or operational complexity.\nTo cope with such trade-offs, architectural patterns such as saga workflows,\nevent sourcing, and outbox integration are discussed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5f02\u6784\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6bd4\u8f83\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u3001\u6587\u6863\u578b\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u884c\u4e1a\u6848\u4f8b\u53ca\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u53ca\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u589e\u52a0\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u91c7\u7528\u5982saga\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7b49\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002"}}

However, publishing these data directly leads to privacy\nleaks. $w$-event privacy is a valuable tool to protect individual privacy\nwithin a given time window while maintaining high accuracy in data collection.\nMost existing $w$-event privacy studies on infinite data stream only focus on\nhomogeneous privacy requirements for all users. In this paper, we propose\npersonalized $w$-event privacy protection that allows different users to have\ndifferent privacy requirements in private data stream estimation. Specifically,\nwe design a mechanism that allows users to maintain constant privacy\nrequirements at each time slot, namely Personalized Window Size Mechanism\n(PWSM). Then, we propose two solutions to accurately estimate stream data\nstatistics while achieving $w$-event level $\\epsilon$ personalized differential\nprivacy ( ($w$, $\\epsilon$)-EPDP), namely Personalized Budget Distribution\n(PBD) and Peronalized Budget Absorption (PBA). PBD always provides at least the\nsame privacy budget for the next time step as the amount consumed in the\nprevious release. PBA fully absorbs the privacy budget from the previous $k$\ntime slots, while also borrowing from the privacy budget of the next $k$ time\nslots, to increase the privacy budget for the current time slot. We prove that\nboth PBD and PBA outperform the state-of-the-art private stream estimation\nmethods while satisfying the privacy requirements of all users. We demonstrate\nthe efficiency and effectiveness of our PBD and PBA on both real and synthetic\ndata sets, compared with the recent uniformity $w$-event approaches, Budget\nDistribution (BD) and Budget Absorption (BA). Our PBD achieves 68% less error\nthan BD on average on real data sets.

Existing methods\nstruggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two\nchallenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and\nthe difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and\naudio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a\nunified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first\nchallenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text,\nreference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage\nprogressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the\nsubject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual\ngeneration abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive\nimage injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly\nadopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy\nthat implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For\njoint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on\npreviously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual\nsync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control,\nwe design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically\nadjusts guidance weights across denoising steps.

Furthermore, by extending the\ndataset size to over 12,000 high-quality trajectories, we established a new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) among Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct based LLMs on the\nOpenHands agent framework, which increases the resolve rate on\nSWE-Bench-Verified by +21.8% for the 7B model and +46.0% for the 32B model and\nvalidates the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "SWE-Mirror\u5229\u7528GitHub\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u73b0\u6709Gym\u73af\u5883\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u521b\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709Gym\u73af\u5883\u548cGitHub\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u5386\u53f2\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7SWE-Mirror\u7ba1\u9053\u63d0\u70bc\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u914d\u7f6e\u597d\u7684Gym\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528SWE-Mirror\u751f\u6210\u4e8660,671\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728OpenHands\u6846\u67b6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u3002", "conclusion": "SWE-Mirror\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Models fare poorly on\nOVCs due to a lack of necessary knowledge a priori. In such situations, a\ndomain expert can provide correct constructs at inference time based on their\npreferences or domain knowledge. Our goal is to effectively reuse this\ninference-time, expert-provided knowledge for future parses without retraining\nthe model. We present dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing(DKAP), where in\naddition to the input sentence, the model receives (dynamically growing) expert\nknowledge as a key-value lexicon that associates NL phrases with correct OVC\nconstructs. We propose ROLex, a retrieval-augmented parsing approach that uses\nthis lexicon. A retriever and a generator are trained to find and use the\nkey-value store to produce the correct parse. A key challenge lies in curating\ndata for this retrieval-augmented parser. We utilize synthetic data generation\nand the data augmentation techniques on annotated (NL sentence, FL statement)\npairs to train the augmented parser.

However, the high mobility of\nsatellites, dynamic traffic patterns, and potential link failures pose\nsignificant challenges for efficient and resilient routing. To address these\nchallenges, we model the LEO satellite network as a time-varying graph\ncomprising a constellation of satellites and ground stations. Our objective is\nto minimize a weighted sum of average delay and packet drop rate. Each\nsatellite independently decides how to distribute its incoming traffic to\nneighboring nodes in real time. Given the infeasibility of finding optimal\nsolutions at scale, due to the exponential growth of routing options and\nuncertainties in link capacities, we propose SKYLINK, a novel fully distributed\nlearning strategy for link management in LEO satellite networks. SKYLINK\nenables each satellite to adapt to the time-varying network conditions,\nensuring real-time responsiveness, scalability to millions of users, and\nresilience to network failures, while maintaining low communication overhead\nand computational complexity. To support the evaluation of SKYLINK at global\nscale, we develop a new simulator for large-scale LEO satellite networks. For\n25.4 million users, SKYLINK reduces the weighted sum of average delay and drop\nrate by 29% compared to the bent-pipe approach, and by 92% compared to\nDijkstra. It lowers drop rates by 95% relative to k-shortest paths, 99%\nrelative to Dijkstra, and 74% compared to the bent-pipe baseline, while\nachieving up to 46% higher throughput.

It further\nincorporates a hybrid self learning mechanism guided by expert feedback,\nallowing the system to continuously improve through DBMS output analysis and\nrule validation. Experiments on benchmarks such as BIRD and BIRD CRITIC, as\nwell as industrial datasets, show that SQLGovernor consistently boosts the\nperformance of base models by up to 10%, while minimizing reliance on manual\nexpertise.

The Semtech SX1280 LoRa transceiver\npresents a promising solution for IoT localization. It combines low cost, low\npower, and precise ranging capability over distances of up to 1 km. However,\nthe ranging process requires two devices to be simultaneously active, one\ninitiating the ranging request and the other responding to it, which can lead\nto significant energy expenditure if not properly managed. Despite the\ntransceiver's excellent performance, no existing system-level framework\neffectively manages sleep-wake coordination and role assignment needed for\nenergy-efficient operation. This paper presents a coordination framework that\nsignificantly reduces power consumption while maintaining the inherent precise\nranging capability of the chip. The framework schedules short, synchronized\nwake-up windows between the initiator and the responder, allowing devices to\nremain in deep sleep for most of their duty cycle. This scheduling strategy\nminimizes reliance on precise continuous timing and mitigates drift in low-cost\noscillators.

This lack of\ntransparency poses security risks, as approximately 84% of the top 1200\ncommonly used artifacts are not built using a transparent CI/CD pipeline.\nConsequently, users must place a significant amount of trust not only in the\nsource code but also in the environment in which these artifacts are built.\n  Rebuilding software artifacts from source provides a robust solution to\nimprove supply chain security. This approach allows for a deeper review of\ncode, verification of binary-source equivalence, and control over dependencies.\nHowever, challenges arise due to variations in build environments, such as JDK\nversions and build commands, which can lead to build failures.

For communication cost, gradient compression by sketching the\nclients' transmitted model updates is often used for reducing per-round\ncommunication. For privacy, the Gaussian mechanism (GM), which consists of\nclipping updates and adding Gaussian noise, is commonly used to guarantee\nclient-level differential privacy. Existing literature on private FL analyzes\nprivacy of sketching and GM in an isolated manner, illustrating that sketching\nprovides privacy determined by the sketching dimension and that GM has to\nsupply any additional desired privacy.\n  In this paper, we introduce the Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM), which\ndirectly combines sketching and the Gaussian mechanism for privacy. Using\nR\\'enyi-DP tools, we present a joint analysis of SGM's overall privacy\nguarantee, which is significantly more flexible and sharper compared to\nisolated analysis of sketching and GM privacy. In particular, we prove that the\nprivacy level of SGM for a fixed noise magnitude is proportional to\n$1/\\sqrt{b}$, where $b$ is the sketching dimension, indicating that (for\nmoderate $b$) SGM can provide much stronger privacy guarantees than the\noriginal GM under the same noise budget.

However, existing FL protocols\nstruggle to defend against Byzantine participants, maintain model utility under\nnon-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, and remain\nlightweight for edge devices. Prior work either assumes trusted hardware, uses\nexpensive cryptographic tools, or fails to address privacy and robustness\nsimultaneously. We propose DSFL, a Dual-Server Byzantine-Resilient Federated\nLearning framework that addresses these limitations using a group-based secure\naggregation approach. Unlike LSFL, which assumes non-colluding semi-honest\nservers, DSFL removes this dependency by revealing a key vulnerability: privacy\nleakage through client-server collusion. DSFL introduces three key innovations:\n(1) a dual-server secure aggregation protocol that protects updates without\nencryption or key exchange, (2) a group-wise credit-based filtering mechanism\nto isolate Byzantine clients based on deviation scores, and (3) a dynamic\nreward-penalty system for enforcing fair participation. DSFL is evaluated on\nMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under up to 30 percent Byzantine participants in\nboth IID and non-IID settings. It consistently outperforms existing baselines,\nincluding LSFL, homomorphic encryption methods, and differential privacy\napproaches. For example, DSFL achieves 97.15 percent accuracy on CIFAR-10 and\n68.60 percent on CIFAR-100, while FedAvg drops to 9.39 percent under similar\nthreats.

Confronting 520 participants with an imaginary situation where\nthey were using an online banking service to invest their inherited money, we\nformed 4 experimental groups. EG1 achieved no further information of their\nrobo-advisor, while EG2 was informed that their robo-advisor was certified by a\nreliable agency for unbiased processes, and EG3 was presented with a formally\nverified robo-advisor that was proven to consider their investment preferences.\nA control group was presented a remote certified human financial advisor. All\ngroups had to decide on how much of their 10,000 euros they would give to their\nadvisor to autonomously invest for them and report on trust and perceived\ndependability. A second manipulation happened afterwards, confronting\nparticipants with either a successful or failed investment. Overall, our\nresults show that the level of quality assurance of the advisor had\nsurprisingly near to no effect of any of our outcome variables, except for\npeople's perception of their own mental model of the advisor. Descriptively,\ndifferences between investments show that seem to favor a verified advisor with\na median investment of 65,000 euros (vs. 50,000).

While previous research has examined factors\ndriving overall engagement, less is known about why certain tweets receive\nunexpectedly high levels of one type of engagement relative to others. Drawing\non Signaling Theory and Attention Economy Theory, we investigate these\nunexpected engagement patterns on Twitter (now known as \"X\"), developing an\n\"unexpectedness quotient\" to quantify deviations from predicted engagement\nlevels. Our analysis of over 600,000 tweets reveals distinct patterns in how\ncontent characteristics influence unexpected engagement. News, politics, and\nbusiness tweets receive more retweets and comments than expected, suggesting\nusers prioritize sharing and discussing informational content. In contrast,\ngames and sports-related topics garner unexpected likes and comments,\nindicating higher emotional investment in these domains. The relationship\nbetween content attributes and engagement types follows clear patterns:\nsubjective tweets attract more likes while objective tweets receive more\nretweets, and longer, complex tweets with URLs unexpectedly receive more\nretweets. These findings demonstrate how users employ different engagement\ntypes as signals of varying strength based on content characteristics, and how\ncertain content types more effectively compete for attention in the social\nmedia ecosystem.

Here, we\ndeveloped and validated a deep reinforcement learning-based decision-support AI\nagent to optimize patient transfer decisions during simulated MCIs by balancing\npatient acuity levels, specialized care requirements, hospital capacities, and\ntransport logistics. To integrate this AI agent, we developed MasTER, a\nweb-accessible command dashboard for MCI management simulations. Through a\ncontrolled user study with 30 participants (6 trauma experts and 24\nnon-experts), we evaluated three interaction approaches with the AI agent\n(human-only, human-AI collaboration, and AI-only) across 20- and 60-patient MCI\nscenarios in the Greater Toronto Area. Results demonstrate that increasing AI\ninvolvement significantly improves decision quality and consistency. The AI\nagent outperforms trauma surgeons (p < 0.001) and enables non-experts to\nachieve expert-level performance when assisted, contrasting sharply with their\nsignificantly inferior unassisted performance (p < 0.001).
