As quantum computing\ntransitions from theory to implementation, developers face issues not present\nin classical software development, such as probabilistic execution, limited\nobservability, shallow abstractions, and low awareness of quantum-specific\ntools. To better understand current practices, we surveyed 26 quantum software\ndevelopers from academia and industry and conducted follow-up interviews\nfocused on testing, debugging, and recurring challenges. All participants\nreported engaging in testing, with unit testing (88%), regression testing\n(54%), and acceptance testing (54%) being the most common. However, only 31%\nreported using quantum-specific testing tools, relying instead on manual\nmethods. Debugging practices were similarly grounded in classical strategies,\nsuch as print statements, circuit visualizations, and simulators, which\nrespondents noted do not scale well. The most frequently cited sources of bugs\nwere classical in nature-library updates (81%), developer mistakes (68%), and\ncompatibility issues (62%)-often worsened by limited abstraction in existing\nSDKs.

A simple yet\neffective way to find bugs in DL frameworks is fuzz testing (Fuzzing).\nUnfortunately, existing fuzzing techniques have not comprehensively considered\nmultiple types of feedback. Additionally, they analyze feedback in a\ncoarse-grained manner, such as mutating the test cases only according to\nwhether the coverage increases. Recently, researchers introduced Large Language\nModels (LLMs) into fuzzing. However, current LLM-based fuzzing techniques only\nfocus on using LLMs to generate test cases while overlooking their potential to\nanalyze feedback information, failing to create more valid and diverse test\ncases. To fill this gap, we propose FUEL to break the seal of Feedback-driven\nfuzzing for DL frameworks. The backbone of FUEL comprises two LLM-based agents,\nnamely analysis LLM and generation LLM. Analysis LLM agent infers analysis\nsummaries from feedback information, while the generation LLM agent creates\ntests guided by these analysis summaries.

The key insight of Morse is to\nreformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking\nadvantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.\nSpecifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with\neach other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,\nbut operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling\nefficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash\nmodel, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the\nobservations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash\nmodel, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the\nDash model without jump sampling.

Although many indoor localization methods have been proposed over\nthe years, they remain too impractical for widespread deployment in the real\nworld. In this paper, we introduce PeepLoc, a deployable and scalable\nWi-Fi-based solution for indoor localization that relies only on pre-existing\ndevices and infrastructure. Specifically, PeepLoc works on any mobile device\nwith an unmodified Wi-Fi transceiver and in any indoor environment with a\nsufficient number of Wi-Fi access points (APs) and pedestrian traffic. At the\ncore of PeepLoc is (a) a mechanism which allows any Wi-Fi device to obtain\nnon-cooperative time-of-flight (ToF) to any Wi-Fi AP and (b) a novel\nbootstrapping mechanism that relies on pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) and\ncrowdsourcing to opportunistically initialize pre-existing APs as anchor points\nwithin an environment. We implement PeepLoc using commodity hardware and\nevaluate it extensively across 4 campus buildings. We show PeepLoc leads to a\nmean and median positional error of 3.41 m and 3.06 m respectively, which is\nsuperior to existing deployed indoor localization systems and is competitive\nwith commodity GPS in outdoor environments."}

We show that all\nconsistent channel selection functions are equivalent to the function that\nalways selects the smallest-index channel under appropriate channel relabeling.\nThis leads to a natural representation of a consistent channel hopping\nalgorithm as a sequence of permutations. For the two-user MRP, we characterize\nrendezvous time slots using a fictitious user and derive tight bounds on the\nmaximum time-to-rendezvous (MTTR) and expected time-to-rendezvous (ETTR).\nNotably, the ETTR is shown to be the inverse of the Jaccard index when\npermutations are randomly selected.

Research efforts have been dedicated\nto improving different aspects of FL, such as algorithm improvement, resource\nallocation, and client selection, to enable its deployment in distributed edge\nnetworks for practical applications. One of the reasons for the poor FL model\nperformance is due to the worker dropout during training as the FL server may\nbe located far away from the FL workers. To address this issue, an Hierarchical\nFederated Learning (HFL) framework has been introduced, incorporating an\nadditional layer of edge servers to relay communication between the FL server\nand workers. While the HFL framework improves the communication between the FL\nserver and workers, large number of communication rounds may still be required\nfor model convergence, particularly when FL workers have non-independent and\nidentically distributed (non-IID) data.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a\nsynthetic-data-empowered HFL framework that mitigates the statistical issues\narising from non-IID local datasets while also incentivizing FL worker\nparticipation. In our proposed framework, the edge servers reward the FL\nworkers in their clusters for facilitating the FL training process. To improve\nthe performance of the FL model given the non-IID local datasets of the FL\nworkers, the edge servers generate and distribute synthetic datasets to FL\nworkers within their clusters. FL workers determine which edge server to\nassociate with, considering the computational resources required to train on\nboth their local datasets and the synthetic datasets."}

For the information systems being designed and developed to\nsupport researchers and scientists in conducting their work, conceptual models\nof the relevant domains are usually designed as both blueprints for a system\nbeing developed and as a means of communication between the designer and\ndeveloper. Most conceptual modelling concepts are generic in the sense that\nthey are applied with the same understanding across many applications. Problems\nin the life sciences, however, are especially complex and important, because\nthey deal with humans, their well-being, and their interactions with the\nenvironment as well as other organisms. This work proposes a systemist\nperspective for creating a conceptual model of a life scientist's problem. We\nintroduce the notion of a system and then show how it can be applied to the\ndevelopment of an information system for handling genomic-related information.\nWe extend our discussion to show how the proposed systemist perspective can\nsupport the modelling of precision medicine. This research recognizes\nchallenges in life sciences research of how to model problems to better\nrepresent the connections between physical and digital worlds. We propose a new\nnotation that explicitly incorporates systemist thinking, as well as the\ncomponents of systems based on recent ontological foundations. The new notation\ncaptures important semantics in the domain of life sciences. It may be used to\nfacilitate understanding, communication and problem-solving more broadly. We\nalso provide a precise, sound, ontologically supported characterization of the\nterm system, as a basic construct for conceptual modelling in life sciences."}

An\nexperimental evaluation over 684432 programs using two algorithms (Quantum\nFourier Transform (QFT) and Grover) shows that Bloq consistently outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art approach Proq, notably as circuit depth and noise\nincrease. For Grover, Bloq achieves a mean F1 score across all experimental\ninstances of 0.74 versus 0.38 for Proq under ideal conditions, and maintains\nperformance under noise (0.43 versus 0.06). Bloq also reduces Proq's runtime by\na factor of 5 and circuit depth overhead by a factor of 23. These results\nunderline Bloq's potential to make assertion-based debugging scalable and\neffective for near-term quantum devices."}

Most prior work has relied on scripted or\nWizard-of-Oz behaviors, limiting our understanding of how real-time,\ninteractive learning can be supported by artificial agents. This study\naddresses this gap by introducing Interactive Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a\ncognitive model for teachable social robots. We conducted two between-subject\nexperiments with 58 primary school children, who either taught a robot or\npracticed independently on a tablet while learning French vocabulary\n(memorization) and grammatical rules (inference). The robot, powered by\nInteractive RL, learned from the child's evaluative feedback. Children in the\nLbT condition achieved significantly higher retention gains compared to those\nin the self-practice condition, especially on the grammar task. Learners with\nlower prior knowledge benefited most from teaching the robot. Behavioural\nmetrics revealed that children adapted their teaching strategies over time and\nengaged more deeply during inference tasks. This work makes two contributions:\n(1) it introduces Interactive RL as a pedagogically effective and scalable\nmodel for peer-robot learning, and (2) it demonstrates, for the first time, the\nfeasibility of deploying multiple autonomous robots simultaneously in real\nclassrooms. These findings extend theoretical understanding of LbT by showing\nthat social robots can function not only as passive tutees but as adaptive\npartners that enhance meta-cognitive engagement and long-term learning\noutcomes."}

We formalize the key elements involved in protection\ndecision-making - including code artifacts, assets, security requirements,\nattacks, and software protections - and frame the protection process through a\ngame-theoretic model. In this model, a defender strategically applies\nprotections to various code artifacts of a target application, anticipating\nrepeated attack attempts by adversaries against the confidentiality and\nintegrity of the application's assets. The selection of the optimal defense\nmaximizes resistance to attacks while ensuring the application remains usable\nby constraining the overhead introduced by protections. The game is solved\nthrough a heuristic based on a mini-max depth-first exploration strategy,\naugmented with dynamic programming optimizations for improved efficiency.\nCentral to our formulation is the introduction of the Software Protection\nIndex, an original contribution that extends existing notions of potency and\nresilience by evaluating protection effectiveness against attack paths using\nsoftware metrics and expert assessments. We validate our approach through a\nproof-of-concept implementation and expert evaluations, demonstrating that\nautomated software protection is a practical and effective solution for risk\nmitigation in software."}

This work explores what\nhappens when this statement is taken literally and applied to robots. Here we\npresent a robot system that employs a moving robot head with a screen-based eye\nmodel that can direct the robot's gaze to points in physical space and present\na reflection-like mirror image of the attended region on top of each eye. We\nconducted a user study with 33 participants, who were asked to instruct the\nrobot to perform pick-and-place tasks, monitor the robot's task execution, and\ninterrupt it in case of erroneous actions. Despite a deliberate lack of\ninstructions about the role of the eyes and a very brief system exposure,\nparticipants felt more aware about the robot's information processing, detected\nerroneous actions earlier, and rated the user experience higher when eye-based\nmirroring was enabled compared to non-reflective eyes.

However, existing\ncomputer-based procedures (CBPs) often lack semantic integration with\nhuman-system interfaces (HSIs), limiting their capacity to support intelligent\nautomation and increasing the risk of human error, particularly under dynamic\nor complex operating conditions. In this study, we present AutoGraph, a\nknowledge-graph-based framework designed to formalize and automate procedure\nexecution in digitalized NPP environments.AutoGraph integrates (1) a proposed\nHTRPM tracking module to capture operator interactions and interface element\nlocations; (2) an Interface Element Knowledge Graph (IE-KG) encoding spatial,\nsemantic, and structural properties of HSIs; (3) automatic mapping from textual\nprocedures to executable interface paths; and (4) an execution engine that maps\ntextual procedures to executable interface paths. This enables the\nidentification of cognitively demanding multi-action steps and supports fully\nautomated execution with minimal operator input. We validate the framework\nthrough representative control room scenarios, demonstrating significant\nreductions in task completion time and the potential to support real-time human\nreliability assessment. Further integration into dynamic HRA frameworks (e.g.,\nCOGMIF) and real-time decision support systems (e.g., DRIF) illustrates\nAutoGraph extensibility in enhancing procedural safety and cognitive\nperformance in complex socio-technical systems."}

Two\nmajor limitations of current manual dataset construction are (1)\nlabor-intensive and error-prone annotation processes limiting the scale,\nquality, and evolution of the dataset, and (2) absence of standardized\nclassification rules results in inconsistent vulnerability categories and\nlabeling results across different datasets. To address these limitations, we\npresent FORGE, the first automated approach for constructing smart contract\nvulnerability datasets. FORGE leverages an LLM-driven pipeline to extract\nhigh-quality vulnerabilities from real-world audit reports and classify them\naccording to the CWE, the most widely recognized classification in software\nsecurity. FORGE employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to extract structured and\nself-contained vulnerability information from these reports. Additionally, it\nuses a tree-of-thoughts technique to classify the vulnerability information\ninto the hierarchical CWE classification. To evaluate FORGE's effectiveness, we\nrun FORGE on 6,454 real-world audit reports and generate a dataset comprising\n81,390 solidity files and 27,497 vulnerability findings across 296 CWE\ncategories. Manual assessment of the dataset demonstrates high extraction\nprecision and classification consistency with human experts (precision of 95.6%\nand inter-rater agreement k-$\\alpha$ of 0.87). We further validate the\npracticality of our dataset by benchmarking 13 existing security tools on our\ndataset. The results reveal the significant limitations in current detection\ncapabilities.
