While LLMs excel at producing documentation from code alone, we\nhypothesize that incorporating formally verified invariants yields more\ncomplete and accurate results. We present a systematic comparison of\ndocumentation generated from JML-annotated and non-annotated Java classes,\nevaluating quality through both automated metrics and expert analysis. Our\nfindings demonstrate that JML significantly improves class-level documentation\ncompleteness, with more moderate gains at the method level. Formal\nspecifications prove particularly effective in capturing complex class\ninvariants and design contracts that are frequently overlooked in code-only\ndocumentation. A threshold effect emerges, where the benefits of JML become\nmore pronounced for classes with richer sets of invariants. While JML enhances\nspecification coverage, its impact on core descriptive quality is limited,\nsuggesting that formal specifications primarily ensure comprehensive coverage\nrather than fundamentally altering implementation descriptions. These results\noffer actionable insights for software teams adopting formal methods in\ndocumentation workflows, highlighting scenarios where JML provides clear\nadvantages.

The fundamental mechanisms underlying\nquantum computation required the development and construction of quantum\ncomputers. These devices are referred to as NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale\nQuantum) devices. Not only are NISQ devices extremely limited in their qubit\ncount but they also suffer from noise during computation and this problem only\ngets worse as the size of the circuit increases which limits the practical use\nof quantum computers for modern day applications. This paper will focus on\nutilizing quantum circuit partitioning to overcome the inherent issues of NISQ\ndevices. Partitioning a quantum circuit into smaller subcircuits has allowed\nfor the execution of quantum circuits that are too large to fit on one quantum\ndevice. There have been many previous approaches to quantum circuit\npartitioning and each of these approaches differ in how they work with some\nfocusing on hardware-aware partitioning, optimal graph-based partitioning,\nmulti-processor architectures and many more. These approaches achieve success\nin their objective but they often fail to scale well which impacts cost and\nnoise. The ultimate goal of this paper is to mitigate these issues by\nminimizing 3 important metrics; noise, time and cost. To achieve this we use\ndynamic partitioning for practical circuit cutting and we take advantage of the\nbenefits of hybrid execution where classical computation will be used alongside\nquantum hardware.

A hybrid CPU-GPU execution model is adopted, in which\nnumerical components are selectively assigned to either the CPU or the GPU,\ndepending on considerations of performance or convenience. This design enables\na progressive porting strategy, allowing most features of the original\nCPU-based codebase to be gradually and seamlessly adapted to GPU execution.

Central to\nthis approach is the use of modern C++, including standard parallel algorithms\nand template metaprogramming techniques, which permit the generation of\nhardware-agnostic computational kernels. This facilitates the development of\nuser-defined, GPU-accelerated components such as collision operators or\nboundary conditions, while preserving compatibility with the existing codebase\nand avoiding the need for external libraries or non-standard language\nextensions.

To provide a framework that better internalizes a wide\nrange of computational effects, this paper puts forward the notion of Monadic\nCombinatory Algebras (MCAs). MCAs generalize the notion of PCAs by structuring\nthe combinatory algebra over an underlying computational effect, embodied by a\nmonad. We show that MCAs can support various side effects through the\nunderlying monad, such as non-determinism, stateful computation and\ncontinuations.

This study presents ASTAGEN, an initial step toward\nautomating SATD taxonomy generation using large language models (LLMs). Given a\ncomment and its surrounding code, ASTAGEN first generates a concise explanation\nfor each SATD comment, then incrementally generates and updates categories to\nconstruct a taxonomy. We evaluate ASTAGEN on SATD datasets from three domains:\nquantum software, smart contracts, and machine learning. It successfully\nrecovers domain-specific categories reported in prior work, such as Layer\nConfiguration in machine learning. Compared to a naive use of an LLM, ASTAGEN\nproduces more consistent category assignments due to its explanation-driven,\niterative design. It also completes taxonomy generation in under two hours and\nfor less than one USD, even on the largest dataset.

This ambiguity presents theoretical\nchallenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human\nintentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed\nfor non-social technologies, leaving their applicability to anthropomorphic\nsystems unclear.

Through partial least squares structural equation modeling,\nwe found that human-like and system-like trust significantly influenced student\nperceptions, with varied effects. Human-like trust more strongly predicted\ntrusting intention, while system-like trust better predicted behavioral\nintention and perceived usefulness.

However, most existing AV safety evaluation methods are primarily\ndesigned for simple maneuvers such as car-following and lane-changing. While\nsuitable for basic tests, these methods are insufficient for assessing\nhigh-level automation functions deployed in more complex environments. First,\nthese methods typically use crash rate as the evaluation metric, whose accuracy\nheavily depends on the quality and completeness of naturalistic driving\nenvironment data used to estimate scenario probabilities. Such data is often\ndifficult and expensive to collect. Second, when applied to diverse scenarios,\nthese methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, making large-scale\nevaluation computationally intractable. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes a novel framework for full-scenario AV safety evaluation. A unified\nmodel is first introduced to standardize the representation of diverse driving\nscenarios. This modeling approach constrains the dimension of most scenarios to\na regular highway setting with three lanes and six surrounding background\nvehicles, significantly reducing dimensionality.

Effectively detecting and localizing\nsuch silent bugs in distributed training is challenging. Common debugging\npractice using metrics like training loss or gradient norm curves can be\ninefficient and ineffective. Additionally, obtaining intermediate tensor values\nand determining whether they are correct during silent bug localization is\ndifficult, particularly in the context of low-precision training.\n  To address those challenges, we design and implement TTrace, the first system\ncapable of detecting and localizing silent bugs in distributed training.

Feed-forward scene\nreconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly\ncreate digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing\nmodels are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of\nmoving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene\nreconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training\ndata and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an\nenhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and\ndense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian\nrepresentation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view\nsynthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network\nthat achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive\nqualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves\ndynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods,\nwhile significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic\nreconstruction method on real-world examples.

To address this, recent approaches adopt iterative\ntraining of base and class HVs, typically accelerated on GPUs. Inference,\nhowever, remains lightweight and well-suited for real-time execution.

Existing network traffic forecasting approaches\noperate under the assumption that the network traffic data is fully observed.\nHowever, in practical scenarios, the collected data are often incomplete due to\nvarious human and natural factors. In this paper, we propose a generative model\napproach for real-time network traffic forecasting with missing data. Firstly,\nwe model the network traffic forecasting task as a tensor completion problem.\nSecondly, we incorporate a pre-trained generative model to achieve the low-rank\nstructure commonly associated with tensor completion. The generative model\neffectively captures the intrinsic low-rank structure of network traffic data\nduring pre-training and enables the mapping from a compact latent\nrepresentation to the tensor space. Thirdly, rather than directly optimizing\nthe high-dimensional tensor, we optimize its latent representation, which\nsimplifies the optimization process and enables real-time forecasting. We also\nestablish a theoretical recovery guarantee that quantifies the error bound of\nthe proposed approach.

QR\nfactorization is a critical sub-routine in Sequential Least Squares Quadratic\nProgramming (SLSQP) for solving non-linear programming (NLP) problems.

Both groups recognised\nits potential to enhance training and improve interaction quality. However, we\nfound a key tension emerged: while peer supporters engaged meaningfully,\nexperts consistently flagged critical issues in peer supporter responses, such\nas missed distress cues and premature advice-giving. This misalignment\nhighlights potential limitations in current peer support training, especially\nin emotionally charged contexts where safety and fidelity to best practices are\nessential. Our findings underscore the need for standardised, psychologically\ngrounded training, especially as peer support scales globally.

At the same time, SHI is already common in\ncommercial software development, but with potentially different foci. This\nstudy clarifies the extent to which established SHI practices are able to\ncontribute to rAI efforts as well as potential disconnects -- essential\ninsights to inform and tailor future interventions that further shift industry\npractice towards rAI efforts. First, we analysed 56 rAI guidance documents to\nidentify why SHI is recommended (i.e. its expected benefits for rAI) and\nuncovered goals such as redistributing power, improving socio-technical\nunderstandings, anticipating risks, and enhancing public oversight. To\nunderstand why and how SHI is currently practised in commercial settings, we\nthen conducted an online survey (n=130) and semi-structured interviews (n=10)\nwith AI practitioners.

This work introduces a scalable\nframework for fidelity tracking in PE therapy, with potential to support\nclinician training, supervision, and quality assurance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u8f6c\u5f55\u6587\u672c\u81ea\u52a8\u5b9a\u4f4dPE\u6cbb\u7597\u5173\u952e\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728313\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6cbb\u7597\u4f1a\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30PE\u6cbb\u7597\u5e08\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u8d39\u65f6\u8d39\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578bQwen2-Audio\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LoRA\u6280\u672f\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7ed3\u540830\u79d2\u7a97\u53e3\u5904\u7406\u97f3\u9891\u8f6c\u5f55\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5173\u952e\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8d77\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff08LoRA\u79e98\uff0c30\u79d2\u7a97\u53e3\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a5.3\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aPE\u6cbb\u7597\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8a\u57f9\u8bad\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}
