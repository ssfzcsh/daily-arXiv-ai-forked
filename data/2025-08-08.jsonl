To maintain service, any\nmodifications to the service functionality must be made on the fly -- i.e., as\nthe service continues to process client requests -- but doing so is\nchallenging. The central difficulty is that of avoiding potential\ninconsistencies caused by ''mixed mode'' operation, where workers of current\nand new versions are concurrently active and interact via the data store. Some\nupdate methods avoid mixed mode altogether, but only at the cost of substantial\ninefficiency -- by doubling resources (memory and compute), or by halving\nthroughput. The alternative is a so-called ''rolling'' update, which is\nuncontrolled and runs the risk of serious service failures arising from\ninconsistent mixed-mode behavior.\n  In this paper, we present the first algorithms that guarantee consistency for\nmixed mode updates. The algorithms rely on semantic properties of service\nactions, such as commutativity. We show that semantic awareness is required, by\nproving that any semantically oblivious, mixed-mode update method cannot avoid\ninconsistencies. Ideally, it should appear to every client that a service\nupdate takes effect atomically; this ensures that a client is not exposed to\ninconsistent mixed-mode behavior.

The idea is that after looking at a distant object, users either\nshift their gaze to the hand or move their hand into view-triggering the\ncreation of a scaled near-space proxy of the object and its surrounding\ncontext. The proxy remains active until the eye-hand pattern is released.

Our solution incorporates a\nlightweight network-system simulator, enabling offline training of a Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO) agent in approximately 45 minutes on average, thereby\novercoming the impracticality of lengthy online training in production\nnetworks. AutoMDT's modular design decouples I/O and network tasks, allowing\nthe agent to capture complex buffer dynamics precisely and to adapt quickly to\nchanging system and network conditions. Evaluations on production-grade\ntestbeds show that AutoMDT achieves up to 8x faster convergence and a 68%\nreduction in transfer completion times compared with state-of-the-art\nsolutions."}

However, in practical\napplications, EEG recordings are susceptible to the effects of various\nphysiological artifacts. Current approaches typically treat denoising and\nemotion recognition as independent tasks using cascaded architectures, which\nnot only leads to error accumulation, but also fails to exploit potential\nsynergies between these tasks. Moreover, conventional EEG-based emotion\nrecognition models often rely on the idealized assumption of \"perfectly\ndenoised data\", lacking a systematic design for noise robustness. To address\nthese challenges, a novel framework that deeply couples denoising and emotion\nrecognition tasks is proposed for end-to-end noise-robust emotion recognition,\ntermed as Feedback-Driven Collaborative Network for Denoising-Classification\nNexus (FDC-Net). Our primary innovation lies in establishing a dynamic\ncollaborative mechanism between artifact removal and emotion recognition\nthrough: (1) bidirectional gradient propagation with joint optimization\nstrategies; (2) a gated attention mechanism integrated with frequency-adaptive\nTransformer using learnable band-position encoding. Two most popular EEG-based\nemotion datasets (DEAP and DREAMER) with multi-dimensional emotional labels\nwere employed to compare the artifact removal and emotion recognition\nperformance between ASLSL and nine state-of-the-art methods. In terms of the\ndenoising task, FDC-Net obtains a maximum correlation coefficient (CC) value of\n96.30% on DEAP and a maximum CC value of 90.31% on DREAMER. In terms of the\nemotion recognition task under physiological artifact interference, FDC-Net\nachieves emotion recognition accuracies of 82.3+7.1% on DEAP and 88.1+0.8% on\nDREAMER."}

The CDS helps designers think critically and make informed\nimprovements using heuristic evaluation.

Critical thinking is particularly crucial for visualisation\ndesigners and tool developers, especially those new to the field, such as\nstudying visualisation in higher education. The CDS consists of three stages\nacross six perspectives: Stage 1 captures the essence of the idea by assigning\nan indicative title and selecting five adjectives (from twenty options) to form\ninitial impressions of the design. Stage 2 involves an in-depth critique using\n30 heuristic questions spanning six key perspectives - user, environment,\ninterface, components, design, and visual marks. Stage 3 focuses on\nsynthesising insights, reflecting on design decisions, and determining the next\nsteps forward. We introduce the CDS and explore its use across three\nvisualisation modules in both undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Our\nlongstanding experience with the CDS has allowed us to refine and develop it\nover time: from its initial creation through workshops in 2017/18 to\nimprovements in wording and the development of two applications by 2020,\nfollowed by the expansion of support notes and refinement of heuristics through\n2023; while using it in our teaching each year.

In most research focused on developing new AV control\nalgorithms (controllers), the performance of these algorithms is assessed\nsolely based on performance metrics such as collision avoidance or lane-keeping\nefficiency, while largely overlooking the human-centred dimensions of\ninteraction with HDVs. This paper proposes a structured evaluation framework\nthat addresses this gap by incorporating metrics grounded in the human-robot\ninteraction literature. The framework spans four key domains: a) interaction\neffect, b) interaction perception, c) interaction effort, and d) interaction\nability. These domains capture both the performance of the AV and its impact on\nhuman drivers around it. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, we apply\nit to a case study evaluating how a state-of-the-art AV controller interacts\nwith human drivers in a merging scenario in a driving simulator. Measuring\nHDV-HDV interactions as a baseline, this study included one representative\nmetric per domain: a) perceived safety, b) subjective ratings, specifically how\nparticipants perceived the other vehicle's driving behaviour (e.g.,\naggressiveness or predictability) , c) driver workload, and d) merging success.\nThe results showed that incorporating metrics covering all four domains in the\nevaluation of AV controllers can illuminate critical differences in driver\nexperience when interacting with AVs. This highlights the need for a more\ncomprehensive evaluation approach. Our framework offers researchers,\ndevelopers, and policymakers a systematic method for assessing AV behaviour\nbeyond technical performance, fostering the development of AVs that are not\nonly functionally capable but also understandable, acceptable, and safe from a\nhuman perspective."}

Second,\nmany existing studies employ contrastive learning to derive more generalized\nmedical sequence representations for diagnostic tasks, usually relying on\nmanually designed diverse positive and negative sample pairs.

To this end, we allow the novice to say: \"I\nplan to do this, but I am uncertain.\" We introduce the Active Skill-level Data\nAggregation (ASkDAgger) framework, which leverages teacher feedback on the\nnovice plan in three key ways: (1) S-Aware Gating (SAG): Adjusts the gating\nthreshold to track sensitivity, specificity, or a minimum success rate; (2)\nForesight Interactive Experience Replay (FIER), which recasts valid and\nrelabeled novice action plans into demonstrations; and (3) Prioritized\nInteractive Experience Replay (PIER), which prioritizes replay based on\nuncertainty, novice success, and demonstration age.
