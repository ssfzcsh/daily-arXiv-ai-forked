The focus is on quantum\nand hybrid quantum-classical software systems, where model-driven approaches\ncan help reduce the costs and mitigate the risks associated with the\nheterogeneous platform landscape and lack of developers' skills. We validate\none of the proposed ideas regarding generating code out of UML model instances\nof software systems. This Python code uses a well-established library, called\nQiskit, to execute on gate-based or circuit-based quantum computers. The RAG\npipeline that we deploy incorporates sample Qiskit code from public GitHub\nrepositories. Experimental results show that well-engineered prompts can\nimprove CodeBLEU scores by up to a factor of four, yielding more accurate and\nconsistent quantum code. However, the proposed research direction can go beyond\nthis through further investigation in the future by conducting experiments to\naddress our other research questions and ideas proposed here, such as deploying\nsoftware system model instances as the source of information in the RAG\npipelines, or deploying LLMs for code-to-code transformations, for instance,\nfor transpilation use cases."}

FL can be categorized into centralized and\ndecentralized paradigms. The centralized paradigm relies on a central server to\naggregate local models, potentially resulting in single points of failure,\ncommunication bottlenecks, and exposure of model parameters. In contrast, the\ndecentralized paradigm, which does not require a central server, provides\nimproved robustness and privacy. The essence of federated learning lies in\nleveraging multiple local updates for efficient communication. However, this\napproach may result in slower convergence or even convergence to suboptimal\nmodels in the presence of heterogeneous and imbalanced data. To address this\nchallenge, we study decentralized federated averaging via random walk (DFedRW),\nwhich replaces multiple local update steps on a single device with random walk\nupdates. Traditional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and its decentralized\nversions commonly ignore stragglers, which reduces the amount of training data\nand introduces sampling bias. Therefore, we allow DFedRW to aggregate partial\nrandom walk updates, ensuring that each computation contributes to the model\nupdate. To further improve communication efficiency, we also propose a\nquantized version of DFedRW. We demonstrate that (quantized) DFedRW achieves\nconvergence upper bound of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{k^{1-q}})$ under convex\nconditions.

This paper\nintroduces a zero-shot KWS approach that leverages state-of-the-art\nself-supervised learning (SSL) models, including Wav2Vec2, HuBERT and Data2Vec.\nFeatures are extracted layer-wise from these SSL models and used to train a\nKaldi-based DNN KWS system. The WSJCAM0 adult speech dataset was used for\ntraining, while the PFSTAR children's speech dataset was used for testing,\ndemonstrating the zero-shot capability of our method. Our approach achieved\nstate-of-the-art results across all keyword sets for children's speech.\nNotably, the Wav2Vec2 model, particularly layer 22, performed the best,\ndelivering an ATWV score of 0.691, a MTWV score of 0.7003 and probability of\nfalse alarm and probability of miss of 0.0164 and 0.0547 respectively, for a\nset of 30 keywords. Furthermore, age-specific performance evaluation confirmed\nthe system's effectiveness across different age groups of children. To assess\nthe system's robustness against noise, additional experiments were conducted\nusing the best-performing layer of the best-performing Wav2Vec2 model. The\nresults demonstrated a significant improvement over traditional MFCC-based\nbaseline, emphasizing the potential of SSL embeddings even in noisy conditions.\nTo further generalize the KWS framework, the experiments were repeated for an\nadditional CMU dataset. Overall the results highlight the significant\ncontribution of SSL features in enhancing Zero-Shot KWS performance for\nchildren's speech, effectively addressing the challenges associated with the\ndistinct characteristics of child speakers."}

Developers are\nincreasingly questioning whether model trainers have obtained proper\nauthorization before using repositories for training, especially given the lack\nof transparency in data collection.\n  To address these concerns, we propose a novel data marking framework RepoMark\nto audit the data usage of code LLMs. Our method enables repository owners to\nverify whether their code has been used in training, while ensuring semantic\npreservation, imperceptibility, and theoretical false detection rate (FDR)\nguarantees. By generating multiple semantically equivalent code variants,\nRepoMark introduces data marks into the code files, and during detection,\nRepoMark leverages a novel ranking-based hypothesis test to detect memorization\nwithin the model. Compared to prior data auditing approaches, RepoMark\nsignificantly enhances sample efficiency, allowing effective auditing even when\nthe user's repository possesses only a small number of code files.\n  Experiments demonstrate that RepoMark achieves a detection success rate over\n90\\% on small code repositories under a strict FDR guarantee of 5\\%. This\nrepresents a significant advancement over existing data marking techniques, all\nof which only achieve accuracy below 55\\% under identical settings. This\nfurther validates RepoMark as a robust, theoretically sound, and promising\nsolution for enhancing transparency in code LLM training, which can safeguard\nthe rights of repository owners."}

However, their heavy\nreliance on large amounts of data, often collected from unsanitized online\nsources, exposes them to data poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject\nmalicious samples to subtly bias model behavior. Recent targeted attacks\nsilently replace secure code with semantically equivalent but vulnerable\nimplementations without relying on explicit triggers to launch the attack,\nmaking it especially hard for detection methods to distinguish clean from\npoisoned samples. We present a systematic study on the effectiveness of\nexisting poisoning detection methods under this stealthy threat model.\nSpecifically, we perform targeted poisoning on three DL models (CodeBERT,\nCodeT5+, AST-T5), and evaluate spectral signatures analysis, activation\nclustering, and static analysis as defenses. Our results show that all methods\nstruggle to detect triggerless poisoning, with representation-based approaches\nfailing to isolate poisoned samples and static analysis suffering false\npositives and false negatives, highlighting the need for more robust,\ntrigger-independent defenses for AI-assisted code generation."}
