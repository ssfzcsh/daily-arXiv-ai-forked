We test LLMs of different types and\nsizes in their capabilities of achieving important properties of process\nexecution, including enforcing process flow, resource allocation, and\ndata-based conditions. Our results show that LLM performance falls short of the\nperfect reliability required for smart contract development.

The enhanced\nunimodal features are then fused and passed through the CNN-Mamba backbone,\nenabling local-to-global cross-modal interaction and comprehensive multimodal\nintegration.

At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those\nmanipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider\nauthentic (i.e., \"natural\") video. In this paper, we show how coding very\nsubtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat\nthis advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification.\nOur approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under\ncoded illumination.

(1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization\nfor hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy\ndegradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform\nquantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like\ndistributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform\nnature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring\ndequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during\ninference.

Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt\nsteering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent\nmemory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language\nbackbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the\nMD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts\npath-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from\n2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations\nconfirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention\nfusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's\nshorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower\nfuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving\nstacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well."}

In\ncontrast, Ising model-based decoders reduce topological complexity but demand\nconsiderable decoding time. We propose the Symmetric One-Hot Matching Elector\n(SOME), a novel decoder that reformulates the QEC decoding task as a Quadratic\nUnconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem -- termed the One-Hot QUBO\n(OHQ). Each variable in the QUBO represents whether a given pair of flipped\nsyndromes is matched, while the error probabilities between the pair are\nencoded as interaction coefficients (weight). Constraints ensure that each\nflipped syndrome is matched exactly once. Valid solutions of OHQ correspond to\nself-inverse permutation matrices, characterized by symmetric one-hot encoding.\nTo solve the OHQ efficiently, SOME reformulates the decoding task as the\nconstruction of permutation matrices that minimize the total weight. It\ninitializes each candidate matrix from one of the minimum-weight syndrome\npairs, then iteratively appends additional pairs in ascending order of weight,\nand finally selects the permutation matrix with the lowest total energy. SOME\nachieves up to a 99.9x reduction in variable count and reduces decoding times\nfrom milliseconds to microseconds on a single-threaded commodity CPU.

Simulation tools are essential for\noptimizing the transmission parameters and, therefore, the energy efficiency\nand performance of LoRaWAN networks. While existing simulation frameworks\naccurately replicate real-world scenarios by including multiple layers of\ncommunication protocols, they often imply significant computational overhead\nand simulation times.

FAST-LoRa\nstreamlines computation by relying on analytical models without complex\npacket-level simulations and implementing gateway reception using efficient\nmatrix operations.

Additionally,\npush-based communication is used to proactively send critical data without\nwaiting for a request. This adaptive approach ensures timely, context-aware,\nand efficient data delivery across different network conditions. To achieve\nhigh energy efficiency, we incorporate a wake-up radio mechanism and we design\na tailored medium access control (MAC) protocol that supports data traffic\nbelonging to the different communication classes.

Yet, many solutions involve cumbersome setups\nthat inhibit natural motion. In tennis, existing products require sensors on\nthe racket or dominant arm, causing distractions and discomfort. We propose\nSilent Impact, a novel and user-friendly system that analyzes tennis shots\nusing a sensor placed on the passive arm. Collecting Inertial Measurement Unit\nsensor data from 20 recreational tennis players, we developed neural networks\nthat exclusively utilize passive arm data to detect and classify six shots,\nachieving a classification accuracy of 88.2% and a detection F1 score of 86.0%,\ncomparable to the dominant arm. These models were then incorporated into an\nend-to-end prototype, which records passive arm motion through a smartwatch and\ndisplays a summary of shots on a mobile app. User study (N=10) showed that\nparticipants felt less burdened physically and mentally using Silent Impact on\nthe passive arm. Overall, our research establishes the passive arm as an\neffective, comfortable alternative for tennis shot analysis, advancing\nuser-friendly sports analytics."}

The RS ranks the available\nannotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using\ntheir past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as\ninformation about the instance queried.
