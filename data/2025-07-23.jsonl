Traditional approaches to mobile application translation often rely\non manual intervention or rule-based systems, which are labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming.

Large Language Models (LLMs) were\nrecently leveraged to enhance code translation at different granularities,\nincluding the method, class, and repository levels.

Given an image, we first dream plausible multi-views using a\nvideo diffusion model, capturing rich geometric and appearance details. These\nviews are then lifted into unstructured 3D Gaussians.

However, manually writing annotations can be time-consuming and\ntedious. The result is that most real-world Python code remains largely\nuntyped. Past approaches to annotating types in Python code fall short in a\nnumber of ways. Static approaches struggle with dynamic features and infer\noverly broad types. AI-based methods are inherently unsound and can miss rare\nor user-defined types. Dynamic methods can impose extreme runtime overheads,\ndegrading performance by up to 270x, abort execution as they exhaust resources,\nand even infer incorrect types that lead to runtime errors. Crucially, all\nprior work assumes implicitly that the code to be annotated is already correct.\nThis assumption is generally unwarranted, especially for large codebases that\nhave been untyped.\n  This paper presents RightTyper, a novel approach for Python that overcomes\nthese disadvantages. RightTyper not only generates precise type annotations\nbased on actual program behavior, improving recall in type checking relative to\nprior approaches.

To this end, we fine-tuned the PaliGemma 3B model using LoRA,\nincorporating Differential Attention, and experimented with various parameter\nsettings and configurations. We demonstrate that Differential Attention can be\nadapted and integrated into the fine-tuning of existing models to enhance noisy\ninformation retrieval and question-answering capabilities."}

However, conventional\nRISs are fundamentally limited by the double path loss effect, which severely\nattenuates the reflected signals. To overcome this, active RIS architectures,\ncapable of amplifying impinging signals, have been proposed. This chapter\ninvestigates the modeling, performance analysis, and optimization of active\nRISs, focusing on two hardware designs: a dual-RIS structure with a single\nPower Amplifier (PA), and a reflection amplification structure at the unit cell\nlevel using tunnel diodes. For the PA-based design, a comprehensive\nmathematical model is developed, and closed-form expressions for the received\nsignal-to-noise ratio, bit error probability, and Energy Efficiency (EE) are\nderived. An optimization framework for configuring the phase shifts and\namplifier gain is proposed to maximize system capacity under power constraints.\nRegarding the second design, the integration of a tunnel diode into the unit\ncell is carefully studied by analyzing its I-V characteristic, enabling the\nderivation of the negative resistance range and the power consumption model.\nFurthermore, the intrinsic phase-amplitude coupling of the reflection\ncoefficient is characterized through compact linear algebra formulations,\nenabling practical optimization of active RISs. Extensive numerical simulations\nvalidate the theoretical analyses, demonstrating that active RISs can\neffectively overcome the double path loss limitation and achieve favorable EE\ntrade-offs compared to passive RISs. Finally, the trade-off between the\navailable power budget and the number of active elements is examined, revealing\nthat a higher number of active elements does not always lead to optimal\nperformance."}

The basic idea is to delegate\nto an LLM the assessment of the \"quality\" of the output provided by an\nautomated technique for tasks for which: (i) quantitative metrics would only\ntell part of the story, and; (ii) a large-scale human-based evaluation would be\ntoo expensive. LLMs-as-a-judge, if proven effective for a specific task, can\nalso unlock new possibilities for automation, with several LLMs proposing a\nsolution for a given instance of the task and others judging and deciding what\nis the best output to show the user. We study the effectiveness of\nLLMs-as-a-judge for two code-related tasks, namely code generation and code\nsummarization. The rationale for choosing these tasks is two-fold. First,\nquantitative metrics are usually not enough for the assessment of code\nsummarizers/generators. For example, it is well documented that metrics such as\nBLEU are quite weak proxies for the quality of the generated summaries. Second,\neven state-of-the-art techniques still struggle with handling complex instances\nof these tasks, making them good candidates for benefiting from more advanced\nsolutions envisioning collaboration among LLMs. For code generation, we check\nwhether eight LLMs are able to judge the correctness of 1,405 Java methods and\n1,281 Python functions generated by the same LLMs or implemented by humans. For\ncode summarization, we compare the judgment of five LLMs to those provided by\nnine humans for ~1.2k summaries, related to both Java and Python functions.

The code fragments\nthat preserve the logic of known vulnerabilities are known as vulnerable code\nclones (VCCs). Detecting those VCCs is a critical but challenging task.\nExisting VCC detection tools often rely on syntactic similarity or produce\ncoarse vulnerability predictions without clear explanations, limiting their\npractical utility. In this paper, we propose VulCoCo, a lightweight and\nscalable approach that combines embedding-based retrieval with large language\nmodel (LLM) validation. Starting from a set of known vulnerable functions, we\nretrieve syntactically or semantically similar candidate functions from a large\ncorpus and use an LLM to assess whether the candidates retain the\nvulnerability. Given that there is a lack of reproducible vulnerable code clone\nbenchmarks, we first construct a synthetic benchmark that spans various clone\ntypes.\n  Our experiments on the benchmark show that VulCoCo outperforms prior\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of Precision@k and mean average precision\n(MAP). In addition, we also demonstrate VulCoCo's effectiveness in real-world\nprojects by submitting 400 pull requests (PRs) to 284 open-source projects.\nAmong them, 75 PRs were merged, and 15 resulted in newly published CVEs.

This\nflexibility, potential, and growing adoption demands a holistic and\ncross-disciplinary approach to developing, monitoring and discussing the\ncapabilities required for agent-driven user experiences. However, current\nguidance on human-centered AI agent development is scattered: UX heuristics\nfocus on interface behaviors, engineering taxonomies describe internal\npipelines, and ethics checklists address high-level governance. There is no\nconcise, user-facing vocabulary that tells teams what an agent should\nfundamentally be able to do. We introduce ADEPTS, a capability framework\ndefining a set of core user-facing capabilities to provide unified guidance\naround the development of AI agents. ADEPTS is based on six principles for\nhuman-centered agent design, that express the minimal, user-facing capabilities\nan AI agent should demonstrate to be understandable, controllable and\ntrustworthy in everyday use. ADEPTS complements existing frameworks and\ntaxonomies; differently from them, it sits at the interface between technical\nand experience development. By presenting ADEPTS, we aim to condense complex\nAI-UX requirements into a compact framework that is actionable guidance for AI\nresearchers, designers, engineers, and policy reviewers alike. We believe\nADEPTS has the potential of accelerating the improvement of user-relevant agent\ncapabilities, of easing the design of experiences that take advantage of those\ncapabilities, and of providing a shared language to track and discuss progress\naround the development of AI agents."}

However, developers frequently produce\ntangled commits that mix unrelated changes due to practical constraints or\nunclear boundaries, negatively impacting code review and maintenance. Although\nprior commit untangling approaches: rule-based, feature-based, or graph-based,\nhave made progress, they often rely on shallow signals and fail to distinguish\nbetween explicit dependencies (e.g., control/data flow) and implicit ones\n(e.g., semantic or conceptual relationships). In this paper, we propose\nColaUntangle, a new collaborative consultation framework for commit untangling\nthat models both explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes.\nColaUntangle integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents in a\nmulti-agent architecture: one agent specializes in explicit dependencies,\nanother in implicit ones, and a reviewer agent synthesizes their perspectives\nthrough iterative consultation. To capture explicit and implicit contextual\ninformation, we construct multi-version Program Dependency Graphs (delta-PDG),\nenabling agents to reason over code relationships with both symbolic and\nsemantic depth. We evaluate ColaUntangle on two widely-used datasets (1,612 C#\nand 14k Java tangled commits). Experimental results show that ColaUntangle\noutperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an improvement of 44% on\nthe C# dataset and 100% on the Java dataset.

Traditional automated\ntranslation methods rely heavily on handcrafted transformation rules, which\noften lack flexibility and scalability. Meanwhile, advanced language models\npresent promising alternatives but are often limited by proprietary, API-based\nimplementations that raise concerns over data security and reliance. In this\npaper, we present Auto-Train for Code Translation (ACT), an innovative\nframework that aims to improve code translation capabilities by enabling\nin-house finetuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). ACT's\nautomated pipeline significantly boosts the performance of these models,\nnarrowing the gap between open-source accessibility and the high performance of\nclosed-source solutions. Central to ACT is its synthetic data generation\nmodule, which builds extensive, high-quality datasets from initial code\nsamples, incorporating unit tests to ensure functional accuracy and diversity.\nACT's evaluation framework incorporates execution-level checks, offering a\ncomprehensive assessment of translation quality. A key feature in ACT is its\ncontroller module, which manages the entire pipeline by dynamically adjusting\nhyperparameters, orchestrating iterative data generation, and finetuning based\non real-time evaluations. This enables ACT to intelligently optimize when to\ncontinue training, generate additional targeted training data, or stop the\nprocess. Our results demonstrate that ACT consistently enhances the\neffectiveness of open-source models, offering businesses and developers a\nsecure and reliable alternative. Additionally, applying our data generation\npipeline to industry-scale migration projects has led to a notable increase in\ndeveloper acceleration."}

While existing ethical frameworks emphasize Consent, Credit,\nand Compensation (C3), they do not adequately address the emergent risks\ninvolving vocal identities that are increasingly decoupled from context,\nauthorship, and control. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 20 professional\nvoice actors, this paper reveals how the synthetic replication of voice without\nenforceable constraints exposes individuals to a range of threats. Beyond\nreputational harm, such as re-purposing voice data in erotic content, offensive\npolitical messaging, and meme culture, we document concerns about\naccountability breakdowns when their voice is leveraged to clone voices that\nare deployed in high-stakes scenarios such as financial fraud, misinformation\ncampaigns, or impersonation scams. In such cases, actors face social and legal\nfallout without recourse, while very few of them have a legal representative or\nunion protection. To make sense of these shifting dynamics, we introduce the\nPRAC3 framework, an expansion of C3 that foregrounds Privacy, Reputation,\nAccountability, Consent, Credit, and Compensation as interdependent pillars of\ndata used in the synthetic voice economy. This framework captures how privacy\nrisks are amplified through non-consensual training, how reputational harm\narises from decontextualized deployment, and how accountability can be\nreimagined AI Data ecosystems. We argue that voice, as both a biometric\nidentifier and creative labor, demands governance models that restore creator\nagency, ensure traceability, and establish enforceable boundaries for ethical\nreuse."}

To\nbridge this gap, we introduce Screen2AX, the first framework to automatically\ncreate real-time, tree-structured accessibility metadata from a single\nscreenshot. Our method uses vision-language and object detection models to\ndetect, describe, and organize UI elements hierarchically, mirroring macOS's\nsystem-level accessibility structure. To tackle the limited availability of\ndata for macOS desktop applications, we compiled and publicly released three\ndatasets encompassing 112 macOS applications, each annotated for UI element\ndetection, grouping, and hierarchical accessibility metadata alongside\ncorresponding screenshots. Screen2AX accurately infers hierarchy trees,\nachieving a 77% F1 score in reconstructing a complete accessibility tree.\nCrucially, these hierarchy trees improve the ability of autonomous agents to\ninterpret and interact with complex desktop interfaces.
