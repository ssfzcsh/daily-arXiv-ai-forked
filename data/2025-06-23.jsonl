In this study, we investigated the prevalence of\ncommunity smells and their relationship with SATD in open-source ML projects,\nanalyzing data at the release level. First, we examined the prevalence of ten\ncommunity smell types across the releases of 155 ML-based systems and found\nthat community smells are widespread, exhibiting distinct distribution patterns\nacross small, medium, and large projects. Second, we detected SATD at the\nrelease level and applied statistical analysis to examine its correlation with\ncommunity smells. Our results showed that certain smells, such as Radio Silence\nand Organizational Silos, are strongly correlated with higher SATD occurrences.\nThird, we considered the six identified types of SATD to determine which\ncommunity smells are most associated with each debt category. Our analysis\nrevealed authority- and communication-related smells often co-occur with\npersistent code and design debt.

To\nimprove support for high-level languages without incurring significant code\nsize or performance overheads, Wasm continuously evolves by integrating\nhigh-level features such as Garbage Collection and Stack Switching. However,\nexisting compilation approaches either lack reusable design -- requiring\nredundant implementation efforts for each language -- or lose abstraction by\nlowering high-level constructs into low-level shared representations like LLVM\nIR, which hinder the adoption of high-level features. MLIR compiler\ninfrastructure provides the compilation pipeline with multiple levels of\nabstraction, preserving high-level abstractions throughout the compilation\npipeline, yet the current MLIR pipeline relies on the LLVM backend for Wasm\ncode generation, thereby inheriting LLVM's limitations.\n  This paper presents a novel compilation pipeline for Wasm, featuring Wasm\ndialects explicitly designed to represent high-level Wasm constructs within\nMLIR. Our approach enables direct generation of high-level Wasm code from\ncorresponding high-level MLIR dialects without losing abstraction, providing a\nmodular and extensible way to incorporate high-level Wasm features. We\nillustrate this extensibility through a case study that leverages Stack\nSwitching, a recently introduced high-level feature of Wasm. Performance\nevaluations on PolyBench benchmarks show that our pipeline, benefiting from\noptimizations within the MLIR and Wasm ecosystems, produces code with at most\n7.7\\% slower, and faster in some execution environments, compared to LLVM-based\ncompilers."}

In this paper,\nwe extensively evaluate the performance of LoRaWAN indoors and then use the key\ninsights to boost its reliability and energy-efficiency by proposing LoRaIN,\nLoRa Indoor Network, a new link-layer protocol that can be effectively used for\nindoor deployments. The approach to boosting the reliability and energy\nefficiency in LoRaIN is underpinned by enabling constructive interference with\nspecific timing requirements analyzed both empirically and mathematically for\ndifferent pairs of channel bandwidth and spreading factor and relaying precious\nacknowledgments to the end-devices with the assistance of several booster\nnodes. The booster nodes do not need any special capability and can be a subset\nof the LoRa end-devices.

However, prior studies have mostly targeted\ntask- or model-specific scenarios, leaving the challenge of universal feature\ncoding across diverse large models largely unaddressed. In this paper, we\npresent the first systematic study on universal feature coding for large\nmodels. The key challenge lies in the inherently diverse and distributionally\nincompatible nature of features extracted from different models. For example,\nfeatures from DINOv2 exhibit highly peaky, concentrated distributions, while\nthose from Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) are more dispersed and uniform. This\ndistributional heterogeneity severely hampers both compression efficiency and\ncross-model generalization. To address this, we propose a learned\npeaky-to-balanced distribution transformation, which reshapes highly skewed\nfeature distributions into a common, balanced target space. This transformation\nis non-uniform, data-driven, and plug-and-play, enabling effective alignment of\nheterogeneous distributions without modifying downstream codecs. With this\nalignment, a universal codec trained on the balanced target distribution can\neffectively generalize to features from different models and tasks. We validate\nour approach on three representative large models-LLaMA3, DINOv2, and\nSD3-across multiple tasks and modalities. Extensive experiments show that our\nmethod achieves notable improvements in both compression efficiency and\ncross-model generalization over task-specific baselines.

Specifically, we adopt three types of DRL\nalgorithms to construct a reliable value network and policy network, which\nguide the online deduction process of interactive MCTS by assisting in value\nupdate and node selection. Then, a dynamic trajectory planner and a trajectory\ntracking controller are designed and implemented in CARLA to ensure smooth\nexecution of planned maneuvers. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our\nBIDA not only enhances interactive deduction and reduces computational costs,\nbut also outperforms other latest benchmarks, which exhibits superior safety,\nefficiency and interaction rationality under varying traffic conditions."}

Distributed computing architectures (DCAs) have gained prominence\nto address these issues. This shift has significantly expanded the attack\nsurface, requiring additional security measures to protect all components --\nfrom sensors and actuators to edge nodes and central servers. Recent incidents\nhighlight the difficulty of this task: Cyberattacks, like distributed denial of\nservice attacks, continue to pose severe threats and cause substantial damage.\nImplementing a holistic defense mechanism remains an open challenge,\nparticularly against attacks that demand both enhanced resilience and rapid\nresponse. Addressing this gap requires innovative solutions to enhance the\nsecurity of DCAs. In this work, we present our holistic self-adaptive security\nframework which combines different adaptation strategies to create\ncomprehensive and efficient defense mechanisms. We describe how to incorporate\nthe framework into a real-world use case scenario and further evaluate its\napplicability and efficiency.

Volumetric\nparameterization for 3D solid manifolds plays an important role in processing\n3D data. However, the conventional approaches cannot control the bijectivity\nand local geometric distortions of the result mappings due to the complex\nstructure of the solid manifolds. Moreover, prior methods mainly focus on one\nproperty instead of balancing different properties during the mapping process.\nIn this paper, we propose several novel methods for computing volumetric\nparameterizations for 3D simply-connected manifolds. Analogous to surface\nparameterization, our framework incorporates several models designed to\npreserve geometric structure, achieve density equalization, and optimally\nbalance geometric and density distortions. With these methods, various 3D\nmanifold parameterizations with different desired properties can be achieved.\nThese methods are tested on different examples and manifold remeshing\napplications, demonstrating their effectiveness and accuracy."}

Specifically, we first introduce the notion\nof Wasserstein distance to explicitly illustrate the heterogeneous effort and\nreformulate the existing upper bound of convergence. To induce truthful\nreporting from agents, we analyze and measure the generalization error gap of\nany two agents by leveraging the peer prediction mechanism to develop score\nfunctions. We further present a two-stage Stackelberg game model that\nformalizes the process and examines the existence of equilibrium.

A major challenge in achieving adequate explanations is the\nelicitation of individual explanation needs, as it may be subject to severe\nhypothetical or confirmation biases. To address these challenges, we aim to\nestablish user-based indicators concerning user behavior or system events that\ncan be captured at runtime to determine when a need for explanations arises. In\nthis work, we conducted explorative research in form of an online study to\ncollect self-reported indicators that could indicate a need for explanation. We\ncompiled a catalog containing 17 relevant indicators concerning user behavior,\n8 indicators concerning system events and 14 indicators concerning emotional\nstates or physical reactions. We also analyze the relationships between these\nindicators and different types of need for explanation. The established\nindicators can be used in the elicitation process through prototypes, as well\nas after publication to gather requirements from already deployed applications\nusing telemetry and usage data. Moreover, these indicators can be used to\ntrigger explanations at appropriate moments during the runtime."}

However, current\nsystems may overlook essential para-linguistic cues, including emotion and\nattitude, which are critical for fully conveying the meaning of visual content.\nThe absence of these cues can limit user understanding or, in some cases,\ndistort the video's original intent. Expressive speech effectively conveys\nthese cues and enhances the user's comprehension of videos. Building on these\ninsights, this paper explores the usage of vision-context-aware expressive\nspeech in enhancing users' understanding of videos in video commentary systems.\nFirstly, our formatting study indicates that semantic-only speech can lead to\nambiguity, and misaligned emotions between speech and visuals may distort\ncontent interpretation. To address this, we propose a method called\nvision-context-aware speech synthesis (V-CASS). It analyzes para-linguistic\ncues from visuals using a vision-language model and leverages a\nknowledge-infused language model to guide the expressive speech model in\ngenerating context-aligned speech. User studies show that V-CASS enhances\nemotional and attitudinal resonance, as well as user audio-visual understanding\nand engagement, with 74.68% of participants preferring the system. Finally, we\nexplore the potential of our method in helping blind and low-vision users\nnavigate web videos, improving universal accessibility."}

In\nthis study, we define LLM-generated text within open responses as those\nproduced by any LLM without paraphrasing or refinement, as evaluated by human\ncoders. We then fine-tune GPT-4o to detect LLM-generated responses and assess\nthe impact on learning from LLM misuse. We find that our fine-tuned LLM\noutperforms the existing AI detection tool GPTZero, achieving an accuracy of\n80% and an F1 score of 0.78, compared to GPTZero's accuracy of 70% and macro F1\nscore of 0.50, demonstrating superior performance in detecting LLM-generated\nresponses. We also find that learners suspected of LLM misuse in the open\nresponse question were more than twice as likely to correctly answer the\ncorresponding posttest MCQ, suggesting potential misuse across both question\ntypes and indicating a bypass of the learning process. We pave the way for\nfuture work by demonstrating a structured, code-based approach to improve\nLLM-generated response detection and propose using auxiliary statistical\nindicators such as unusually high assessment scores on related tasks,\nreadability scores, and response duration.

However, the application of human\nmeasurement tools to these systems can produce contradictory results, raising\nconcerns that many findings are measurement phantoms--statistical artifacts\nrather than genuine psychological phenomena. In this Perspective, we argue that\nbuilding a robust science of AI psychology requires integrating two of our\nfield's foundational pillars: the principles of reliable measurement and the\nstandards for sound causal inference. We present a dual-validity framework to\nguide this integration, which clarifies how the evidence needed to support a\nclaim scales with its scientific ambition. Using an LLM to classify text may\nrequire only basic accuracy checks, whereas claiming it can simulate anxiety\ndemands a far more rigorous validation process. Current practice systematically\nfails to meet these requirements, often treating statistical pattern matching\nas evidence of psychological phenomena. The same model output--endorsing \"I am\nanxious\"--requires different validation strategies depending on whether\nresearchers claim to measure, characterize, simulate, or model psychological\nconstructs. Moving forward requires developing computational analogues of\npsychological constructs and establishing clear, scalable standards of evidence\nrather than the uncritical application of human measurement tools."}

This article\nprovides a framework for using LLMs as psychological simulators across two\nprimary applications: simulating roles and personas to explore diverse\ncontexts, and serving as computational models to investigate cognitive\nprocesses. For simulation, we present methods for developing psychologically\ngrounded personas that move beyond demographic categories, with strategies for\nvalidation against human data and use cases ranging from studying inaccessible\npopulations to prototyping research instruments. For cognitive modeling, we\nsynthesize emerging approaches for probing internal representations,\nmethodological advances in causal interventions, and strategies for relating\nmodel behavior to human cognition. We address overarching challenges including\nprompt sensitivity, temporal limitations from training data cutoffs, and\nethical considerations that extend beyond traditional human subjects review.\nThroughout, we emphasize the need for transparency about model capabilities and\nconstraints. Together, this framework integrates emerging empirical evidence\nabout LLM performance--including systematic biases, cultural limitations, and\nprompt brittleness--to help researchers wrangle these challenges and leverage\nthe unique capabilities of LLMs in psychological research."}
