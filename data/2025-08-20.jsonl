Efficient data engineering is\ncritical to handle challenges of latency, scalability, and consistency. Modern\ndata lakehouse formats Delta Parquet, Apache Iceberg, and Apache Hudi offer\nfeatures such as ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and real-time\ningestion, combining the strengths of data lakes and warehouses to support\ncomplex use cases. This study presents a comparative analysis of Delta Parquet,\nIceberg, and Hudi using real-world time-series automotive telemetry data with\nfields such as vehicle ID, timestamp, location, and event metrics. The\nevaluation considers modeling strategies, partitioning, CDC support, query\nperformance, scalability, data consistency, and ecosystem maturity. Key\nfindings show Delta Parquet provides strong ML readiness and governance,\nIceberg delivers high performance for batch analytics and cloud-native\nworkloads, while Hudi is optimized for real-time ingestion and incremental\nprocessing. Each format exhibits tradeoffs in query efficiency, time-travel,\nand update semantics. The study offers insights for selecting or combining\nformats to support fleet management, predictive maintenance, and route\noptimization. Using structured datasets and realistic queries, the results\nprovide practical guidance for scaling data pipelines and integrating machine\nlearning models in automotive applications."}

However, these visual aids do not\nseem to be beneficial for large language models (LLMs) in the same way since\nthe code is processed as a linear sequence of tokens. Furthermore, these\nadditional tokens can lead to increased computational costs and longer response\ntimes for LLMs. If such formatting elements are non-essential to LLMs, we can\nreduce such costs by removing them from the code. To figure out the role played\nby formatting elements, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate\nthe impact of code formatting on LLM performance and efficiency. Through\nlarge-scale experiments on Fill-in-the-Middle Code Completion tasks across four\nprogramming languages (Java, Python, C++, C\\#) and ten LLMs-including both\ncommercial and open-source models-we systematically analyze token count and\nperformance when formatting elements are removed. Key findings indicate that\nLLMs can maintain performance across formatted code and unformatted code,\nachieving an average input token reduction of 24.5\\% with negligible output\ntoken reductions. This makes code format removal a practical optimization\nstrategy for improving LLM efficiency. Further exploration reveals that both\nprompting and fine-tuning LLMs can lead to significant reductions (up to\n36.1\\%) in output code length without compromising correctness. To facilitate\npractical applications, we develop a bidirectional code transformation tool for\nformat processing, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing LLM\ninference workflows, ensuring both human readability and LLM efficiency."}

We introduce INDS (Incremental Named Data Streaming), an adaptive\nstreaming framework based on Information-Centric Networking (ICN) that rethinks\ndelivery for hierarchical, layered media. INDS leverages the Octree structure\nof point cloud video and expressive content naming to support progressive,\npartial retrieval of enhancement layers based on consumer bandwidth and\ndecoding capability. By combining time-windows with Group-of-Frames (GoF),\nINDS's naming scheme supports fine-grained in-network caching and facilitates\nefficient multi-user data reuse. INDS can be deployed as an overlay, remaining\ncompatible with QUIC-based transport infrastructure as well as future\nMedia-over-QUIC (MoQ) architectures, without requiring changes to underlying IP\nnetworks. Our prototype implementation shows up to 80% lower delay, 15-50%\nhigher throughput, and 20-30% increased cache hit rates compared to\nstate-of-the-art DASH-style systems. Together, these results establish INDS as\na scalable, cache-friendly solution for real-time point cloud streaming under\nvariable and lossy conditions, while its compatibility with MoQ overlays\nfurther positions it as a practical, forward-compatible architecture for\nemerging immersive media systems."}

The weakened variant relates\nprocesses p and q with respect to environment e if the join-interaction\nprocesses p & e and q & e of p and q with e are bisimilar.

Join-interaction\nparameterized (ji-parameterized) bisimilarity coincides with parameterized\nbisimilarity for deterministic environments, but that it is a coarser\nequivalence in general. We explain how Larsen's concept can be recovered from\nji-parameterized bisimilarity by 'determinizing' interactions.

However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes\nin videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant\nviewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges\ninclude generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original\nvideo, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into\nrealistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a\nsketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local\nmanipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the\nchallenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate\nedited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining\nframes of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise\ngeometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also\nsupported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and\nmanipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a\ndense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the\ninput video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth\nmaps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them\neffectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited\ncontent with the original video while preserving the features of unedited\nregions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video\ndiffusion model to produce realistic edited videos.

This has led to an\nintensified focus on the study of video steganography, which is a technique\nthat hides data within a video cover to avoid detection. The effectiveness of\nany steganography method depends on its ability to embed data without altering\nthe original video quality while maintaining high efficiency. This paper\nproposes a new method to video steganography, which involves utilizing a\nGenetic Algorithm (GA) for identifying the Region of Interest (ROI) in the\ncover video. The ROI is the area in the video that is the most suitable for\ndata embedding. The secret data is encrypted using the Advanced Encryption\nStandard (AES), which is a widely accepted encryption standard, before being\nembedded into the cover video, utilizing up to 10% of the cover video. This\nprocess ensures the security and confidentiality of the embedded data. The\nperformance metrics for assessing the proposed method are the Peak Signal to\nNoise Ratio (PSNR) and the encoding and decoding time. The results show that\nthe proposed method has a high embedding capacity and efficiency, with a PSNR\nranging between 64 and 75 dBs, which indicates that the embedded data is almost\nindistinguishable from the original video.

The weakened variant relates\nprocesses p and q with respect to environment e if the join-interaction\nprocesses p & e and q & e of p and q with e are bisimilar.

However, the lateral thermal\nblockage effect becomes increasingly important for TSV via farms (a cluster of\nTSV vias used for signal bus connections between layers) because the TSV size\nand pitch continue to scale in {\\mu}m range and the metal to insulator ratio\nbecomes smaller. Consequently, dense TSV farms can create lateral thermal\nblockages in thinned silicon substrate and exacerbate the local hotspots. In\nthis paper, we propose a thermal-aware via farm placement technique for 3-D ICs\nto minimize lateral heat blockages caused by dense signal bus TSV structures."}

By integrating well-established\nuncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo\nDropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we\ndemonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its\napplication on both synthetic and simulation datasets."}

The\nproposed model aims to address several key challenges, including privacy,\ninformation silos, class imbalance, non-identically and independently\ndistributed (Non-IID) data, and model interpretability in supply chain credit\nassessment. We introduce a performance-based client selection strategy (PBCS)\nto tackle class imbalance and Non-IID problems. This strategy achieves faster\nconvergence by selecting clients with higher local F1 scores. The FedProx\narchitecture, enhanced with homomorphic encryption, is used as the core model,\nand further incorporates a transformer encoder. The transformer encoder block\nprovides insights into the learned features. Additionally, we employ the\nintegrated gradient explainable AI technique to offer insights into\ndecision-making. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Trans-XFed through\nexperimental evaluations on real-world supply chain datasets. The obtained\nresults show its ability to deliver accurate credit assessments compared to\nseveral baselines, while maintaining transparency and privacy."}

In contrast, general analog dynamics require both\nnon-linear positive as well as negative terms, seemingly necessitating control\nover not just transcriptional (i.e., production) regulation but also the\ndegradation rates of transcription factors.\n  Surprisingly, we prove that controlling transcription factor production\n(i.e., transcription rate) without explicitly controlling degradation is\nmathematically complete for analog computation, achieving equivalent\ncapabilities to systems where both production and degradation are programmable.\nWe demonstrate our approach on several examples including oscillatory and\nchaotic dynamics, analog sorting, memory, PID controller, and analog extremum\nseeking.

Understanding the natural process through which users\nexit, especially from problematic groups such as conspiracy theory communities\nand the manosphere, can provide valuable insights for designing interventions\ntargeting disengagement from harmful ideologies.

Using a transdisciplinary framework that incorporates theories from\nsocial psychology, organizational behavior, and violent extremism studies, this\nwork identifies a range of factors contributing to disengagement. The results\ndescribe how disengagement from problematic groups, such as conspiracy theories\nand the manosphere, is a multi-faceted process that is qualitatively different\nthan disengaging from more established social structures, such as religions or\npolitical ideologies.
