Test skeletons are especially\nimportant in test-driven development (TDD), where they provide an early\nframework for systematic verification. Traditionally authored manually, their\ncreation can be time-consuming and error-prone, particularly in educational or\nlarge-scale development settings. We evaluate four LLMs -- GPT-4,\nDeepSeek-Chat, Llama4-Maverick, and Gemma2-9B -- on their ability to generate\nRSpec skeletons for a real-world Ruby class developed in a university software\nengineering course. Each model's output is assessed using static analysis and a\nblind expert review to measure structural correctness, clarity,\nmaintainability, and conformance to testing best practices. The study reveals\nkey differences in how models interpret code structure and testing conventions,\noffering insights into the practical challenges of using LLMs for automated\ntest scaffolding.

Motivated by\nthis disparity, we first analyze the cut property of resistance distance. While\na direct generalization proves impractical due to costly matrix operations, we\novercome this limitation by integrating tree decompositions, revealing that the\nresistance distance $r(s,t)$ depends only on labels along the paths from $s$\nand $t$ to the root of the decomposition. This insight enables compact\nlabelling structures. Based on this, we propose \\treeindex, a novel index\nmethod that constructs a resistance distance labelling of size $O(n \\cdot\nh_{\\mathcal{G}})$ in $O(n \\cdot h_{\\mathcal{G}}^2 \\cdot d_{\\max})$ time, where\n$h_{\\mathcal{G}}$ (tree height) and $d_{\\max}$ (maximum degree) behave as small\nconstants in many real-world small-treewidth graphs (e.g., road networks).

These models are\npotentially usable by different stakeholder groups, as they support\npolicy-makers to estimate the consequences of potential interventions and they\ncan guide individuals in making healthy choices in complex environments.\nHowever, this potential may not be fully realized because of the models'\ncomplexity, which makes them inaccessible to the stakeholders who could benefit\nthe most. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate simulation outputs\nand the design of models into text, current approaches typically rely on\none-size-fits-all summaries that fail to reflect the varied informational needs\nand stylistic preferences of clinicians, policymakers, patients, caregivers,\nand health advocates. This limitation stems from a fundamental gap: we lack a\nsystematic understanding of what these stakeholders need from explanations and\nhow to tailor them accordingly. To address this gap, we present a step-by-step\nframework to identify stakeholder needs and guide LLMs in generating tailored\nexplanations of health simulations. Our procedure uses a mixed-methods design\nby first eliciting the explanation needs and stylistic preferences of diverse\nhealth stakeholders, then optimizing the ability of LLMs to generate tailored\noutputs (e.g., via controllable attribute tuning), and then evaluating through\na comprehensive range of metrics to further improve the tailored generation of\nsummaries."}

However, in spite of these\nconcerns, the extent to which conversational AI is used for political\ninformation-seeking, as well the potential impact of this use on users'\npolitical knowledge, remains uncertain. Here, we address these questions:\nFirst, in a representative national survey of the UK public (N = 2,499), we\nfind that in the week before the 2024 election as many as 32% of chatbot users\n- and 13% of eligible UK voters - have used conversational AI to seek political\ninformation relevant to their electoral choice. Second, in a series of\nrandomised controlled trials (N = 2,858 total) we find that across issues,\nmodels, and prompting strategies, conversations with AI increase political\nknowledge (increase belief in true information and decrease belief in\nmisinformation) to the same extent as self-directed internet search. Taken\ntogether, our results suggest that although people in the UK are increasingly\nturning to conversational AI for information about politics, this shift may not\nlead to increased public belief in political misinformation."}

Participants completed\nVR-based tasks measuring reading performance and self-esteem. A preliminary\nstatistical analysis (t tests and Mann Whitney tests) on these data was\nperformed, to compare the obtained scores between individuals with and without\ndyslexia, revealing significant differences in completion time for the SR test,\nbut not in accuracy, nor in self esteem. Then, supervised ML models were\ntrained and tested, demonstrating an ability to classify the presence/absence\nof dyslexia with an accuracy of 87.5 per cent for Italian, 66.6 per cent for\nSpanish, and 75.0 per cent for the pooled group.

However,\nthere remains a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts, due to the\nlimited comprehensibility of XRL results and isolated coverage of current XRL\napproaches that leave users uncertain about which tools to employ. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce TalkToAgent, a multi-agent Large Language Models\n(LLM) framework that delivers interactive, natural language explanations for RL\npolicies. The architecture with five specialized LLM agents (Coordinator,\nExplainer, Coder, Evaluator, and Debugger) enables TalkToAgent to automatically\nmap user queries to relevant XRL tools and clarify an agent's actions in terms\nof either key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual\nexplanations. Moreover, our approach extends previous counterfactual\nexplanations by deriving alternative scenarios from qualitative behavioral\ndescriptions, or even new rule-based policies. We validated TalkToAgent on\nquadruple-tank process control problem, a well-known nonlinear control\nbenchmark. Results demonstrated that TalkToAgent successfully mapped user\nqueries into XRL tasks with high accuracy, and coder-debugger interactions\nminimized failures in counterfactual generation. Furthermore, qualitative\nevaluation confirmed that TalkToAgent effectively interpreted agent's actions\nand contextualized their meaning within the problem domain."}

As a critical\nstep toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer\nvision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We\nadapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear\nratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The\nmodels were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean\nabsolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis\nrevealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance,\nthough further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability\nassessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related\nfeatures. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions\nassociated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted\nspiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer\nvision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both\nmodel explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective\nemotion-aware therapeutic technologies."}

However, the following challenges still exist in prior\nmethods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive\nmechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference\nspeed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable\nof parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and\nsupport for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose\nSparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization\nprecision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are\nsimultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based\ndiscrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a\npre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token\nrouter and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations\ninherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token\ngeneration process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the\ninference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on\na modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model\nto identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.\nMoreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to\nsystematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across\ndiverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach\nconsistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2,\nCAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks.
