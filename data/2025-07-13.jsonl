Two key\nchallenges hinder progress: (1) the high computational overhead during training\ncaused by multi-timestep spike firing, and (2) the absence of large-scale SNN\narchitectures tailored to speech processing tasks. To overcome the issues, we\nintroduce Input-aware Multi-Level Spikeformer, i.e. IML-Spikeformer, a spiking\nTransformer architecture specifically designed for large-scale speech\nprocessing.

Recent literature emphasizes a balanced\napproach termed Hybrid Human-AI Regulated Learning (HHAIRL), in which AI\nprovides targeted, timely scaffolding while preserving the learners' role as\nactive decision-makers and reflective monitors of their learning process.\nNevertheless, existing digital tools frequently fall short, lacking\nadaptability, focusing narrowly on isolated SRL phases, and insufficiently\nsupport meaningful human-AI interactions. In response, this paper introduces\nthe enhanced \\flora Engine, which incorporates advanced Generative Artificial\nIntelligence (GenAI) features and state-of-the-art learning analytics,\nexplicitly grounded in SRL and HHAIRL theories. The \\flora Engine offers\ninstrumentation tools such as collaborative writing, multi-agents chatbot, and\ndetailed learning trace logging to support dynamic, adaptive scaffolding\ntailored to individual needs in real time. We further present a summary of\nseveral research studies that provide the validations for and illustrate how\nthese instrumentation tools can be utilized in real-world educational and\nexperimental contexts. These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of \\flora\nEngine in fostering SRL and HHAIRL, providing both theoretical insights and\npractical solutions for the future of AI-enhanced learning context."}

Classification performance was above chance level, with both groups\nunderestimating their ability to detect Al-generated descriptions. OCR errors\nand hallucinations limited perceived quality, yet descriptions rated higher in\naccuracy and usefulness were harder to classify, suggesting that human review\nis necessary to ensure the accuracy and quality of catalogue descriptions\ngenerated by the out-of-the-box model, particularly in specialized domains like\narchaeological cataloguing. Experts showed lower willingness to adopt AI tools,\nemphasizing concerns on preservation responsibility over technical performance.\nThese findings advocate for a collaborative approach where AI supports draft\ngeneration but remains subordinate to human verification, ensuring alignment\nwith curatorial values (e.g., provenance, transparency). The successful\nintegration of this approach depends not only on technical advancements, such\nas domain-specific fine-tuning, but even more on establishing trust among\nprofessionals, which could both be fostered through a transparent and\nexplainable AI pipeline."}

However, the predominant\nInput-Oriented Mapping (IOM) method for implementing TCONV has complex output\nmapping, overlapping sums, and ineffectual computations. These inefficiencies\nfurther exacerbate the performance bottleneck of TCONV and generative models on\nresource-constrained edge devices. To address this problem, in this paper we\npropose MM2IM, a hardware-software co-designed accelerator that combines Matrix\nMultiplication (MatMul) with col2IM to process TCONV layers on\nresource-constrained edge devices efficiently. Using the SECDA-TFLite design\ntoolkit, we implement MM2IM and evaluate its performance across 261 TCONV\nproblem configurations, achieving an average speedup of 1.9x against a\ndual-thread ARM Neon optimized CPU baseline. We then evaluate the performance\nof MM2IM on a range of TCONV layers from well-known generative models achieving\nup to 4.2x speedup, and compare it against similar resource-constrained TCONV\naccelerators, outperforming them by at least 2x GOPs/DSP. Finally, we evaluate\nMM2IM on the DCGAN and pix2pix GAN models, achieving up to 3x speedup and 2.4x\nenergy reduction against the CPU baseline."}
