While large language models (LLMs)\noffer promising assistance by explaining formula errors, the automated\ncorrection of these semantic runtime errors remains an open problem. A primary\nchallenge to advancing models for such scenarios is the severe lack of\nhigh-quality, comprehensive datasets for training and rigorous evaluation. This\npaper addresses this gap by introducing a novel approach for constructing a\nbenchmark dataset specifically designed for Excel formula repair. We propose a\ndata generation pipeline, which leverages a small set of curated seed samples\nfrom online forums to synthetically expand the dataset. Our pipeline integrates\nfew-shot prompting with LLMs and employs a robust \\textit{LLM-as-a-Judge}\nvalidation framework, combined with execution-based checks to ensure the\ncorrectness and semantic fidelity of the generated data. This process produced\na benchmark dataset of 618 high-quality samples, covering common runtime\nerrors. Furthermore, we propose a context-aware baseline technique for Excel\nformula repair that utilizes LLMs to leverage both the faulty formula, and\nrelevant spreadsheet context. We evaluate the performance of various LLMs\n(GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Phi-3, Mistral) on our newly generated benchmark using\nexecution-based metrics. Our analysis demonstrates the dataset's quality\nthrough manual annotation and provides insights into error and function\ndistributions. The proposed generation methodology is highly scalable and can\nbe readily adapted to create evaluation benchmarks for similar code repair\ntasks in other low-resource programming languages."}

For slower external storage devices, such as HDD\nand SATA SSD, the scan performance is primarily limited by the I/O bandwidth\n(i.e., I/O bound) due to the substantial read/write amplifications in\nLSM-Trees. Recent adoption of high-performance storage devices, such as NVMe\nSSD, has transformed the main limitation to be compute-bound, emerging the\nimpact of computational resource consumption caused by inefficient compactions\nand filtering. However, when the value size increases, the bottleneck for scan\nperformance in fast devices gradually shifts towards the I/O bandwidth as well,\nand the overall throughput across all types of devices undergo a dramatic\nreduction. This paper addresses the core issues by proposing LSM-OPD, a Log-S\ntructured M erge-O rder- Preserving Dictionary encoding scheme that enables\ndirect computing on compressed data within LSM-Trees. It first enables\nkey-value-separated data flushing to disk in a densely encoded columnar layout,\nideally with few bytes for a large string value (e.g., 1024 bytes), thereby\nsignificantly alleviating the frequent I/O requests caused by intensive scans.\nThen, it is capable of offloading the costly scan-based operations on large\nvalues, including compaction and value filtering, to lightweight dictionaries\ndue to the order-preserving property.

The value of NFTs is\nclosely tied to their distinctive characteristics that define rarity, leading\nto a growing interest in quantifying rarity within both industry and academia.\nWhile there are existing rarity meters for assessing NFT rarity, comparing them\ncan be challenging without direct access to the underlying collection data. The\nRating over all Rarities (ROAR) benchmark addresses this challenge by providing\na standardized framework for evaluating NFT rarity. This paper explores a\ndimension reduction approach to rarity design, introducing new performance\nmeasures and meters, and evaluates them using the ROAR benchmark. Our\ncontributions to the rarity meter design issue include developing an optimal\nrarity meter design using non-metric weighted multidimensional scaling,\nintroducing Dissimilarity in Trades (DIT) as a performance measure inspired by\ndimension reduction techniques, and unveiling the non-interpretable rarity\nmeter DIT, which demonstrates superior performance compared to existing\nmethods."}

However, it remains a challenging\ntask. A study on GitHub shows that only 42.2% of the issues are correctly\nlinked to their commits. This highlights the potential for further development\nand research in this area. Existing studies have employed various AI/ML-based\napproaches, and with the recent development of large language models,\nresearchers have leveraged LLMs to tackle this problem. These approaches suffer\nfrom two main issues. First, LLMs are constrained by limited context windows\nand cannot ingest all of the available data sources, such as long commit\nhistories, extensive issue comments, and large code repositories. Second, most\nmethods operate on individual issue-commit pairs; that is, given a single\nissue-commit pair, they determine whether the commit resolves the issue. This\nquickly becomes impractical in real-world repositories containing tens of\nthousands of commits. To address these limitations, we present LinkAnchor, the\nfirst autonomous LLM-based agent designed for issue-to-commit link recovery.\nThe lazy-access architecture of LinkAnchor enables the underlying LLM to access\nthe rich context of software, spanning commits, issue comments, and code files,\nwithout exceeding the token limit by dynamically retrieving only the most\nrelevant contextual data. Additionally, LinkAnchor is able to automatically\npinpoint the target commit rather than exhaustively scoring every possible\ncandidate. Our evaluations show that LinkAnchor outperforms state-of-the-art\nissue-to-commit link recovery approaches by 60-262% in Hit@1 score across all\nour case study projects.

A recent paper by Dal Lago and Ghyselen has shown that the same\nproblem becomes undecidable when the language is extended with algebraic effect\nand handlers (effect handlers). We show that, perhaps surprisingly, the problem\nbecomes decidable even with effect handlers when the type system is extended\nwith answer type modification (ATM). A natural intuition may find the result\ncontradictory, because one would expect allowing ATM makes more programs\ntypable. Indeed, this intuition is correct in that there are programs that are\ntypable with ATM but not without it, as we shall show in the paper. However, a\ncorollary of our decidability result is that the converse is true as well:\nthere are programs that are typable without ATM but becomes untypable with ATM,\nand we will show concrete examples of such programs in the paper. Our\ndecidability result is proven by a novel continuation passing style (CPS)\ntransformation that transforms an ATM-typable finitary PCF program with effect\nhandlers to a finitary PCF program without effect handlers. Additionally, as\nanother application of our CPS transformation, we show that every\nrecursive-function-free ATM-typable finitary PCF program with effect handlers\nterminates, while there are (necessarily ATM-untypable) recursive-function-free\nfinitary PCF programs with effect handlers that may diverge. Finally, we\ndisprove a claim made in a recent work that proved a similar but strictly\nweaker decidability result. We foresee our decidability result to lay a\nfoundation for developing verification methods for programs with effect\nhandlers, just as the decidability result for reachability of finitary PCF has\ndone such for programs without effect handlers."}

As\nstudents increasingly opt for remote learning and recorded lectures,\ntraditional educational approaches struggle to maintain engagement and\neffectiveness. Microlearning, which breaks complex subjects into manageable\nunits, is proposed to address shorter attention spans and enhance educational\noutcomes. It uses interactive formats such as videos, quizzes, flashcards, and\nscenario-based exercises, which are especially beneficial for topics like\nalgorithms and programming logic requiring deep understanding and ongoing\npractice. Adoption of microlearning is often limited by the effort needed to\ncreate such materials. This paper proposes leveraging AI tools, specifically\nChatGPT, to reduce the workload for educators by automating the creation of\nsupplementary materials. While AI can automate certain tasks, educators remain\nessential in guiding and shaping the learning process.

In realistic logic synthesis tasks, e-boost\nproduces 7.6% and 8.1% area improvements compared to conventional synthesis\ntools with two different technology mapping libraries. e-boost is available at\nhttps://github.com/Yu-Maryland/e-boost."}

RealTalk employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate 3D\nfacial landmarks from driving audio, which are concatenated with emotion-label\nembeddings using a ResNet-based landmark deformation model (LDM) to produce\nemotional landmarks. These landmarks and facial blendshape coefficients jointly\ncondition a novel tri-plane attention Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to\nsynthesize highly realistic emotional talking heads.

This work proposes WiDFS 3.0, a lightweight bistatic\nSISO sensing framework that enables accurate delay and Doppler estimation from\ndistorted CSI by effectively suppressing Doppler mirroring ambiguity. It\noperates with only a single antenna at both the transmitter and receiver,\nmaking it suitable for low-complexity deployments. We propose a\nself-referencing cross-correlation (SRCC) method for SISO random phase removal\nand employ delay-domain beamforming to resolve Doppler ambiguity.

Levine", "Matthew Berger"], "title": "Seeing the Many: Exploring Parameter Distributions Conditioned on Features in Surrogates", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.HC"], "comment": null, "summary": "Recently, neural surrogate models have emerged as a compelling alternative to\ntraditional simulation workflows. This is accomplished by modeling the\nunderlying function of scientific simulations, removing the need to run\nexpensive simulations. Beyond just mapping from input parameter to output,\nsurrogates have also been shown useful for inverse problems: output to input\nparameters. Inverse problems can be understood as search, where we aim to find\nparameters whose surrogate outputs contain a specified feature. Yet finding\nthese parameters can be costly, especially for high-dimensional parameter\nspaces. Thus, existing surrogate-based solutions primarily focus on finding a\nsmall set of matching parameters, in the process overlooking the broader\npicture of plausible parameters. Our work aims to model and visualize the\ndistribution of possible input parameters that produce a given output feature.\nTo achieve this goal, we aim to address two challenges: (1) the approximation\nerror inherent in the surrogate model and (2) forming the parameter\ndistribution in an interactive manner. We model error via density estimation,\nreporting high density only if a given parameter configuration is close to\ntraining parameters, measured both over the input and output space. Our density\nestimate is used to form a prior belief on parameters, and when combined with a\nlikelihood on features, gives us an efficient way to sample plausible parameter\nconfigurations that generate a target output feature. We demonstrate the\nusability of our solution through a visualization interface by performing\nfeature-driven parameter analysis over the input parameter space of three\nsimulation datasets.
