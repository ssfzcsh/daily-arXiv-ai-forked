However, many existing methods rely solely on\nsingle-modal data (e.g., metrics, logs, and traces) and struggle to\nsimultaneously address multiple downstream tasks, including anomaly detection\n(AD), failure triage (FT), and root cause localization (RCL). Moreover, the\nlack of clear reasoning evidence in current techniques often leads to\ninsufficient interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose\nTrioXpert, an end-to-end incident management framework capable of fully\nleveraging multimodal data. TrioXpert designs three independent data processing\npipelines based on the inherent characteristics of different modalities,\ncomprehensively characterizing the operational status of microservice systems\nfrom both numerical and textual dimensions. It employs a collaborative\nreasoning mechanism using large language models (LLMs) to simultaneously handle\nmultiple tasks while providing clear reasoning evidence to ensure strong\ninterpretability. We conducted extensive evaluations on two popular\nmicroservice system datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that\nTrioXpert achieves outstanding performance in AD (improving by 4.7% to 57.7%),\nFT (improving by 2.1% to 40.6%), and RCL (improving by 1.6% to 163.1%) tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTrioXpert\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u6545\u969c\u5206\u8bca\u548c\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "TrioXpert\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u63a8\u7406\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTrioXpert\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u6545\u969c\u5206\u8bca\u548c\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e864.7%\u81f357.7%\u30012.1%\u81f340.6%\u548c1.6%\u81f3163.1%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "TrioXpert\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u548c\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u6548\u679c\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u7ef4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

To\nprovide an accessible introduction to the library, the fundamentals of modal\nlogic are outlined first, followed by a concise manual for the proof assistant\nitself. The core contribution of this work on HOLMS is the development of a\nunified and modular strategy for proving adequacy theorems with respect to\nrelational semantics directly within HOL Light for several normal modal\nsystems, currently including K, T, K4, and GL. Adequacy theorems establish a\nformal connection between syntactic proof systems and their intended relational\nmodels, ensuring that derivable statements align with valid ones. This approach\nextends previous research on G\\\"odel-L\\\"ob logic (GL) by two HOLMS developers.\nIt also assesses the generality and compositionality of the completeness proofs\nin George Boolos' monograph \\textit{The logic of provability}. Beyond\ntheoretical contributions, HOLMS incorporates automated decision procedures and\na countermodel constructor for K, T, K4, and GL, illustrating how\ngeneral-purpose proof assistants can be effectively combined with research on\nlabelled sequent calculi and key insights from correspondence and bisimulation\ntheories.

In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields\nsuch as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.\nTraditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for\ndiffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted\nenergy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several\nchallenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping\nartifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when\nextended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy\nformulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based\ndensity-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.\nSpecifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and\ngeometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the\ntransformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates\nsuperior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior\nmethods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can\nbe easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects.

Most organizations utilize In-house servers or Cloud\nresources to manage application data and workload. The traditional database\nmanagement system (DBMS) and HTAP systems spend significant time & resources to\nload the entire dataset into DBMS before starting query execution. On the other\nhand, in-situ engines may reparse required data multiple times, increasing\nresource utilization and data processing costs. Additionally, over or\nunder-allocation of resources also increases application running costs. This\npaper proposes a lightweight Resource Availability &Workload aware Hybrid\nFramework (RAW-HF) to optimize querying raw data by utilizing existing finite\nresources efficiently. RAW-HF includes modules that help optimize the resources\nrequired to execute a given workload and maximize the utilization of existing\nresources.

Recent works\npropose numerous techniques (that we call DRAM techniques) to enhance\nDRAM-based computing systems' throughput, reliability, and computing\ncapabilities (e.g., in-DRAM bulk data copy). Evaluating the system-wide\nbenefits of DRAM techniques is challenging as they often require modifications\nacross multiple layers of the computing stack. Prior works propose FPGA-based\nplatforms for rapid end-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM\nchips. Unfortunately, existing platforms fall short in two major aspects: (1)\nthey require deep expertise in hardware description languages, limiting\naccessibility; and (2) they are not designed to accurately model modern\ncomputing systems.\n  We introduce EasyDRAM, an FPGA-based framework for rapid and accurate\nend-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM chips. EasyDRAM overcomes\nthe main drawbacks of prior FPGA-based platforms with two key ideas. First,\nEasyDRAM removes the need for hardware description language expertise by\nenabling developers to implement DRAM techniques using a high-level language\n(C++). At runtime, EasyDRAM executes the software-defined memory system design\nin a programmable memory controller. Second, EasyDRAM tackles a fundamental\nchallenge in accurately modeling modern systems: real processors typically\noperate at higher clock frequencies than DRAM, a disparity that is difficult to\nreplicate on FPGA platforms. EasyDRAM addresses this challenge by decoupling\nthe processor-DRAM interface and advancing the system state using a novel\ntechnique we call time scaling, which faithfully captures the timing behavior\nof the modeled system.\n  We believe and hope that EasyDRAM will enable innovative ideas in memory\nsystem design to rapidly come to fruition.

However, CFG requires specific training procedures and is limited\nto conditional generation. To address these limitations, we propose Token\nPerturbation Guidance (TPG), a novel method that applies perturbation matrices\ndirectly to intermediate token representations within the diffusion network.\nTPG employs a norm-preserving shuffling operation to provide effective and\nstable guidance signals that improve generation quality without architectural\nchanges. As a result, TPG is training-free and agnostic to input conditions,\nmaking it readily applicable to both conditional and unconditional generation.\nWe further analyze the guidance term provided by TPG and show that its effect\non sampling more closely resembles CFG compared to existing training-free\nguidance techniques. Extensive experiments on SDXL and Stable Diffusion 2.1\nshow that TPG achieves nearly a 2$\\times$ improvement in FID for unconditional\ngeneration over the SDXL baseline, while closely matching CFG in prompt\nalignment.

This paper demonstrates that while hardware acceleration techniques\ncan significantly accelerate RSGA, the high volume of genomic data shifts the\nperformance and energy bottleneck from computation to I/O data movement. As\nsequencing throughput increases, I/O overhead becomes the main contributor to\nboth runtime and energy consumption. Therefore, there is a need to design a\nhigh-performance, energy-efficient system for RSGA that can both alleviate the\ndata movement bottleneck and provide large acceleration capabilities. We\npropose MARS, a storage-centric system that leverages the heterogeneous\nresources within modern storage systems (e.g., storage-internal DRAM, storage\ncontroller, flash chips) alongside their large storage capacity to tackle both\ndata movement and computational overheads of RSGA in an area-efficient and\nlow-cost manner. MARS accelerates RSGA through a novel hardware/software\nco-design approach.

The surface\ncode, known for its high resilience to physical errors, is a leading candidate\nfor fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Logical qubits encoded with the\nsurface code can be in different phases of their syndrome generation cycle,\nthereby introducing desynchronization in the system. This can occur due to the\nproduction of non-Clifford states, dropouts due to fabrication defects, and the\nuse of other QEC codes with the surface code to reduce resource requirements.\nLogical operations require the syndrome generation cycles of the logical qubits\ninvolved to be synchronized. This requires the leading qubit to pause or slow\ndown its cycle, allowing more errors to accumulate before the next cycle,\nthereby increasing the risk of uncorrectable errors.\n  To synchronize the syndrome generation cycles of logical qubits, we define\nthree policies - Passive, Active, and Hybrid. The Passive policy is the\nbaseline, and the simplest, wherein the leading logical qubits idle until they\nare synchronized with the remaining logical qubits. On the other hand, the\nActive policy aims to slow the leading logical qubits down gradually, by\ninserting short idle periods before multiple code cycles.

However, imbalanced pipeline workloads and complex data\ndependencies in the prefill and decode phases result in massive pipeline\nbubbles and further severe performance reduction. To better exploit the\npipeline parallelism for high-throughput LLM inference, we propose TD-Pipe,\nwith the key idea lies in the temporally-disaggregated pipeline parallelism\narchitecture. Specifically, this architecture disaggregates the prefill and\ndecode phases in the temporal dimension, so as to eliminate pipeline bubbles\ncaused by the phase switching. TD-Pipe identifies potential issues of\nexploiting the novel architecture and provides solutions. First, a\nhierarchy-controller structure is used to better coordinate devices in pipeline\nparallelism by decoupling the scheduling from execution. Second, the AI-based\ngreedy prefill approach aggressively performs more prefills by predicting the\noutput length and simulating the memory usage.

Specifically, we achieve\nreal-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the\nmatrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU\nreadings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption\nreduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides\ndiverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for\naccurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in\nreal time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS\nmatrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based\nmodel. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU\nreadings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method.

The architecture incorporates a single or multiple\nradio-frequency chains to receive pilot signals via tunable absorption phase\nprofiles realized by the metasurface front end, as well as a controller\nencompassing a baseband processing unit to carry out channel estimation, and\nconsequently, the optimization of the RIS reflection coefficients. A novel\nchannel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal\ntraining pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable\nabsorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its\nsignal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly\nused by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase\nconfiguration of the metasurface front end. The proposed channel estimation\nalgorithm, which is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers\n(ADMM), profits from the RIS random spatial absorption sampling to capture the\nentire signal space, and exploits the beamspace sparsity and low-rank\nproperties of extremely large MIMO channels, which is particularly relevant for\ncommunication systems at the FR3 band and above. Our extensive numerical\ninvestigations showcase the superiority of the proposed channel estimation\ntechnique over benchmark schemes for various system and RIS hardware\nconfiguration parameters, as well as the effectiveness of using channel\nestimates at the RIS side to dynamically optimize the possibly phase-quantized\nreflection coefficients of its unit elements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u534a\u88ab\u52a8RIS\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u6b63\u4ea4\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e8f\u5217\u548cADMM\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f18\u5316RIS\u53cd\u5c04\u7cfb\u6570\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u88ab\u52a8RIS\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u5347MIMO\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u6bb5\uff08FR3\u53ca\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u6b63\u4ea4\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e8f\u5217\u548cADMM\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RIS\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5438\u6536\u91c7\u6837\u548cMIMO\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e0e\u4f4e\u79e9\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u548cRIS\u786c\u4ef6\u914d\u7f6e\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316RIS\u5355\u5143\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u76f8\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3aRIS\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While speech face alignment is well established, the broader\ndynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand\nmotion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and\nbehavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the\ncoordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn\ntaking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and\nsimultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this\nalignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances\nrealtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony\nacross modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study\nexamines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from\ndyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus.

Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise\ndisplacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech\nfeatures to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently\nelicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness\nshowed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed\ngestures during overlaps.

The\nneuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical\ncircuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear\nresponses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be\nperformed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network\nwas simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic\ntime series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through\nmanipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical\nresponses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive\ncomponents whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the\nmemristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was\nfound to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to\nlearning.

Yet, its\nreliance on a single central server introduces potential bottlenecks and risks\nof single-point failure. Decentralizing the server, often referred to as\ndecentralized learning, addresses this problem by distributing the server role\nacross nodes within the network. One drawback regarding this pure\ndecentralization is it introduces communication inefficiencies, which arise\nfrom increased message exchanges in large-scale setups. However, existing\nproposed solutions often fail to simulate the real-world distributed and\ndecentralized environment in their experiments, leading to unreliable\nperformance evaluations and limited applicability in practice. Recognizing the\nlack from prior works, this work investigates the correlation between model\nsize and network latency, a critical factor in optimizing decentralized\nlearning communication. We propose a graph-based gossiping mechanism, where\nspecifically, minimum spanning tree and graph coloring are used to optimize\nnetwork structure and scheduling for efficient communication across various\nnetwork topologies and message capacities. Our approach configures and manages\nsubnetworks on real physical routers and devices and closely models real-world\ndistributed setups.

Dynamically selecting the\noptimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a\npromising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and\nperformance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive\nand often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on\nhuman-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in\nreal-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task\ndifficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that\ndynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically\nassessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using\nChain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into\nthree difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed\ndifficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best\nmodel for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental\nresults show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score\nwhile reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method\nComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an\napproximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of\ncost consumption. Apart from that, the difficulty assessment using CoT provides\nmore reliable selection criteria than human evaluation.

While the\noriginal RBP assumes that we need to have all the inputs of an operation in\nfast memory at the same time, in many concrete computations, the inputs can be\naggregated one by one into the final output value. These partial computation\nsteps can enable pebbling strategies with much smaller I/O cost, and in\nsettings where such a step-by-step aggregation is possible, this extended\nred-blue pebble game offers a much more realistic cost model.\n  We establish the fundamental properties of this partial-computing red-blue\npebble game (PRBP), and compare it to the original RBP. We begin with some\nsimple examples where allowing partial computations can decrease the optimal\nI/O cost. It is also shown that the cost can decrease by up to a linear factor\nthis way, but in general, it is NP-hard to decide whether partial computations\nallow for a smaller cost in a specific DAG. We then discuss how $S$-partitions,\na crucial tool for deriving I/O lower bounds in RBP, can be adapted to the PRBP\nmodel. These new tools are then used to establish lower bounds on the I/O cost\nof some prominent computational tasks.

However, Federated Audio Classification (FedAC) faces three critical\nchallenges that substantially hinder performance: data heterogeneity, model\nheterogeneity, and data poisoning. While prior works have attempted to address\nthese issues, they are typically treated independently, lacking a unified and\nrobust solution suited to real-world federated audio scenarios. To bridge this\ngap, we propose FedMLAC, a unified mutual learning framework designed to\nsimultaneously tackle these challenges in FedAC. Specifically, FedMLAC\nintroduces a dual-model architecture on each client, comprising a personalized\nlocal AC model and a lightweight, globally shared Plug-in model. Through\nbidirectional knowledge distillation, the Plug-in model enables global\nknowledge transfer while adapting to client-specific data distributions, thus\nsupporting both generalization and personalization. To further enhance\nrobustness against corrupted audio data, we develop a Layer-wise Pruning\nAggregation (LPA) strategy that filters unreliable Plug-in model updates based\non parameter deviations during server-side aggregation.

The code is available at\n  https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer", "summary": "Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges\nin addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data\nsimultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce\nexcessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),\nand introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize\nthe definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a\nModel-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal\nInference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a\nweight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,\nattention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level\nSelf-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a\nMultimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.\nTo tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate\nlabel and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and\nfine-grained counterfactual texts.

Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to\nthe semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract\ncues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the\nphysical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple\nplausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional\nguidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse\ndance movements.

In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language\nModel (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a\nchoreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,\nhigh-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit\nlearning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both\nmore diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of\nthree components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that\nproduces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a\nmulti-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,\nand textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based\nmotion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which\nensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.\nExtensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u5230\u821e\u8e48\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5DanceChat\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6307\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u4e0e\u97f3\u4e50\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u821e\u8e48\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u97f3\u4e50\u4e0e\u821e\u8e48\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e14\u97f3\u4e50\u5230\u821e\u8e48\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u662f\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u6307\u5bfc\u6765\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u821e\u8e48\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "DanceChat\u7531\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u7ec4\u6210\uff1aLLM\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728AIST++\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cDanceChat\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u97f3\u4e50\u5230\u821e\u8e48\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u96be\u9898\u3002"}}

However, the traditional process for creating\nsuch benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in\nthe stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and\nvalidating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated\npipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our\npipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce\nSWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment\nconstruction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a\ncollaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to\nenhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based\ngrading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.\nFinally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit\ncode signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show\nthat our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,\nwith GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per\ninstance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at\nthe lowest cost of $0.024 per instance.

Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if\nit is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other\nwords, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The\nresulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending\nnumber-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender\nsequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for\ninterpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer\nhidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic\nat scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender\nsequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it,\nthe difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We\ndesign a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis\nacross multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek,\nGemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying\nrule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the\nsequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis\nevaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to\nassess model performance.

Yet, despite recent advances,\ntheir output often suffers from syntactic and semantic errors and remains\ndifficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs),\nresearchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output.\nNevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations,\nsuch as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation.\nIn this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that\nharnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via\nreinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving\naccuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of\ndecompiled code: \\textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}.\nCentral to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system\nto score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle,\nD-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher\nscores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically,\nD-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler\nand symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then\nevaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with\nthe original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for\nfine-tuning. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs,\ndemonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the\ncoreutils and util-linux projects.
