With the daily increases in data\nvolumes and frequent content changes, the demand for databases to store and\nretrieve information for the creation of knowledge graphs has become\nincreasingly urgent. The previously established Knowledge Acquisition and\nRepresentation Methodology (KNARM) outlines a systematic approach to address\nthese challenges and create knowledge graphs.

Using this dataset, we developed a Python script that automatically\ngenerates the required classes and their axioms, facilitating a smoother\nintegration process.

Recently, there has also been growing interest in the reverse\ndirection-humans help chatbots-due to a wide range of benefits including better\nchatbot performance, human well-being, and collaborative outcomes. However,\nlittle research has explored the factors that motivate people to help chatbots.\nTo address this gap, we draw on the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA)\nframework to examine how chatbot anthropomorphism-including human-like\nidentity, emotional expression, and non-verbal expression-influences human\nempathy toward chatbots and their subsequent prosocial behaviors and\nintentions. We also explore people's own interpretations of their prosocial\nbehaviors toward chatbots. We conducted an online experiment (N = 244) in which\nchatbots made mistakes in a collaborative image labeling task and explained the\nreasons to participants. We then measured participants' prosocial behaviors and\nintentions toward the chatbots. Our findings revealed that human identity and\nemotional expression of chatbots increased participants' prosocial behavior and\nintention toward chatbots, with empathy mediating these effects. Qualitative\nanalysis further identified two motivations for participants' prosocial\nbehaviors: empathy for the chatbot and perceiving the chatbot as human-like.

This lack of data locality presents significant challenges for\nexecution platforms, ultimately degrading performance. While previous\naccelerator designs have leveraged on-chip memory and data access scheduling\nstrategies to address this issue, they still inevitably access features at\nirregular addresses from DRAM. In this work, we propose LiGNN, a hardware-based\nsolution that improves data locality by applying dropout and merge techniques\nduring neighbor aggregation to accelerate GNN training. Unlike conventional\nalgorithm-level dropout methods that primarily aim to improve accuracy while\noverlooking hardware costs, LiGNN introduces a locality-aware feature dropout\nmechanism. This approach selectively drops node features with data locality\nawareness, effectively reducing irregular DRAM accesses without compromising\nmodel accuracy. Moreover, by leveraging detailed knowledge of memory layout and\norganization-including critical alignment constraints-LiGNN strategically\nmerges memory accesses during neighbor aggregation at the DRAM row level,\nguided by GNN-level semantics. This optimization significantly improves data\nlocality with minimal additional cost. Under the commonly adopted 0.5 dropout\nrate, LiGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering a 1.48~3.02x\nspeedup, reducing DRAM accesses by 34%~55%, and lowering DRAM row activations\nby 59%~82%, all while maintaining model accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Such subclasses can be defined in terms of\nuniversal pairs: bounds on the number of variables $\\nu$ and degree $\\delta$\nsuch that all Diophantine equations can be rewritten in at most this\ncomplexity. Our work develops explicit universal pairs $(\\nu, \\delta)$ for\ninteger unknowns, achieving new bounds that cannot be obtained by naive\ntranslations from known results over $\\mathbb N$.\n  In parallel, we have conducted a formal verification of our results using the\nproof assistant Isabelle. While formal proof verification has traditionally\nbeen applied a posteriori to known results, this project integrates\nformalization into the discovery and development process. In a final section,\nwe describe key insights gained from this unusual approach and its implications\nfor mathematical practice.

Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on\ncharacter consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles\ncharacter modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates\ncinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a\nsingle character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured\nstoryboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,\ncharacter actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we\nintroduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual\nstyle and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's\nfull visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design\nmodule further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame\ncropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the\nstory, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically\nplausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based\nimage-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion\ncustomization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from\ntemporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second\nstage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen\nidentity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent\nvideo scenes aligned with the storyboard.

In this\npaper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter\nconfigurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres:\nHindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.\n  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in\ncapturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short\nmelodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range\ndependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze\ncomputational resource requirements across different adapter scales,\ndemonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal\nbalance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a\ndiffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to\nthe description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in\nnotes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics.

We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity\nas a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable\npersonality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe\nthat changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related\ntraits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize\nmulti-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in\nisolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine\ninteractions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing\nprocesses, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
