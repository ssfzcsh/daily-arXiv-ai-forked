However, some open banking standards remain susceptible to\nsevere technological risks, including unverified data sources, inconsistent\ndata integrity, and lack of immutability.

We implemented a\nproof-of-concept implementation of our solution to evaluate its performance,\nwhere the results demonstrate that the system scales linearly with a stable\nthroughput, exhibits a 100% validation rate, and utilizes under 35% of CPU and\n350 MiB memory.

Accepted Paper in\n  https://computationalcreativity.net/iccc25/wp-content/uploads/papers/iccc25-sood2025conversational.pdf", "summary": "We present a graphical, node-based system through which users can visually\nchain generative AI models for creative tasks. Research in the area of chaining\nLLMs has found that while chaining provides transparency, controllability and\nguardrails to approach certain tasks, chaining with pre-defined LLM steps\nprevents free exploration. Using cognitive processes from creativity research\nas a basis, we create a system that addresses the inherent constraints of\nchat-based AI interactions. Specifically, our system aims to overcome the\nlimiting linear structure that inhibits creative exploration and ideation.\nFurther, our node-based approach enables the creation of reusable, shareable\ntemplates that can address different creative tasks. In a small-scale user\nstudy, we find that our graph-based system supports ideation and allows some\nusers to better visualise and think through their writing process when compared\nto a similar conversational interface. We further discuss the weaknesses and\nlimitations of our system, noting the benefits to creativity that user\ninterfaces with higher complexity can provide for users who can effectively use\nthem."}

However, the current\nimplementation of individual intelligence tasks necessitates isolated knowledge\nretrieval pipelines, resulting in redundant data flows and inconsistent\ninterpretations. Inspired by the service model unification effort in Open-RAN\n(to support interoperability and vendor diversity), we propose KP-A: a unified\nNetwork Knowledge Plane specifically designed for Agentic network intelligence.\nBy decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence\nlogic, KP-A streamlines development and reduces maintenance complexity for\nintelligence engineers. By offering an intuitive and consistent knowledge\ninterface, KP-A also enhances interoperability for the network intelligence\nagents. We demonstrate KP-A in two representative intelligence tasks: live\nnetwork knowledge Q&A and edge AI service orchestration.

AIRS integrates cutting-edge technologies,\nincluding Real-Time 3D Reconstruction (RT-3DR), intelligent navigation, and\nlarge Vision-Language Models (VLMs), to create a comprehensive system for\nmachine-guided physical rehabilitation. The general AIRS framework is\ndemonstrated in rehabilitation scenarios following total knee replacement\n(TKR), utilizing a database of 263 video recordings for evaluation. A\nsmartphone is employed within AIRS to perform RT-3DR of living spaces and has a\nbody-matched avatar to provide visual feedback about the excercise. This avatar\nis necessary in (a) optimizing exercise configurations, including camera\nplacement, patient positioning, and initial poses, and (b) addressing privacy\nconcerns and promoting compliance with the AI Act. The system guides users\nthrough the recording process to ensure the collection of properly recorded\nvideos. AIRS employs two feedback mechanisms: (i) visual 3D feedback, enabling\ndirect comparisons between prerecorded clinical exercises and patient home\nrecordings and (ii) VLM-generated feedback, providing detailed explanations and\ncorrections for exercise errors. The framework also supports people with visual\nand hearing impairments. It also features a modular design that can be adapted\nto broader rehabilitation contexts. AIRS software components are available for\nfurther use and customization."}

Concretely, 6G will need to consider both the\nperformance and sustainability targets for the various use cases it will serve.\nMoreover, like previous generations, 6G will have various candidate\ntechnological enablers, making the design space of the system even more\ncomplex. Furthermore, given the subjective nature of the sustainability\nindicators, in particular social sustainability, there is a significant gap in\nliterature on how technical enablers and 6G System design can be linked to\nthem. Hence, in this article a novel method for 6G end-to-end (E2E) system\ndesign based on Knowledge graphs (KG) has been introduced. It considers as its\ninput: the use case KPIs, use case sustainability requirements expressed as Key\nValues (KV) and KV Indicators (KVIs), the ability of the technological enablers\nto satisfy these KPIs and KVIs, the 6G system design principles defined in\nHexa-X-II project, the maturity of a technological enabler and the dependencies\nbetween the various enablers. As part of the KG method, a novel approach for\ndetermining the key values a technological enabler addresses, has also been\nintroduced. The effectiveness of the KG method was demonstrated by its\napplication in designing the 6G E2E system for the cooperating mobile robot use\ncase defined in the Hexa-X-II project, where 82 enablers were selected. Lastly,\nresults from proof-of-concept demonstrations for a subset of the selected\nenablers have also been provided, which reinforce the efficacy of the KG method\nfor designing a sustainable 6G system."}

To combat this, various \"nudging\" strategies encourage stand-ups.\nBehavior change triggers use explicit prompts such as smartphone push\nnotifications or light controls. However, comparisons of the effects of such\ninteractions, discomfort, and user context have not yet been performed. The\npresent study evaluated these methods in a mixed design experiment with 15\ncollege students. Three intervention methods (none, push notifications, and\nlight dimming) and three user task contexts (computer work, video calls, and\nreading) were tested. The frequency of standing up and comfort were assessed\nafter each ten-minute session. Results showed that dimming resulted in slightly\nmore breaks (1.4 \\pm 1.55) than push notification (1.2 \\pm 1.08), but caused\ndiscomfort for 66.7% of participants, compared to 20% for notification.
