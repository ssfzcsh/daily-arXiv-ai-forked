An Empirical Study on Prompting LLMs to Detect Design Principle Violations", "categories": ["cs.SE", "cs.AI"], "comment": "Accepted to ASE2025", "summary": "Traditional static analysis methods struggle to detect semantic design flaws,\nsuch as violations of the SOLID principles, which require a strong\nunderstanding of object-oriented design patterns and principles. Existing\nsolutions typically focus on individual SOLID principles or specific\nprogramming languages, leaving a gap in the ability to detect violations across\nall five principles in multi-language codebases. This paper presents a new\napproach: a methodology that leverages tailored prompt engineering to assess\nLLMs on their ability to detect SOLID violations across multiple languages. We\npresent a benchmark of four leading LLMs-CodeLlama, DeepSeekCoder, QwenCoder,\nand GPT-4o Mini-on their ability to detect violations of all five SOLID\nprinciples. For this evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset of 240\nmanually validated code examples. Using this dataset, we test four distinct\nprompt strategies inspired by established zero-shot, few-shot, and\nchain-of-thought techniques to systematically measure their impact on detection\naccuracy. Our emerging results reveal a stark hierarchy among models, with\nGPT-4o Mini decisively outperforming others, yet even struggles with\nchallenging principles like DIP. Crucially, we show that prompt strategy has a\ndramatic impact, but no single strategy is universally best; for instance, a\ndeliberative ENSEMBLE prompt excels at OCP detection while a hint-based EXAMPLE\nprompt is superior for DIP violations. Across all experiments, detection\naccuracy is heavily influenced by language characteristics and degrades sharply\nwith increasing code complexity.

In this paper,\nwe identify and solve several previously unaddressed obstacles to realizing\nthis design and identify several optimization opportunities. First, to preserve\nthe kernel's ability to reclaim failed processes, protected library functions\nmust complete in modest, bounded time. We show how to move unbounded waits\noutside the library itself, enabling synchronous interaction among processes\nwithout the need for polling. Second, we show how the bounded time requirement\ncan be leveraged to achieve lower and more stable latency for inter-process\ninteractions. Third, we observe that prior work on protected libraries is\nvulnerable to a buffer unmapping attack; we prevent this attack by preventing\napplications from removing pages that they share with the protected library.\nFourth, we show how a trusted daemon can respond to asynchronous events and\ndynamically divide work with application threads in a protected library.\n  By extending and improving the protected library model, our work provides a\nnew way to structure OS services, combining the advantages of kernel bypass and\nmicrokernels. We present a set of safety and performance guidelines for\ndevelopers of protected libraries, and a set of recommendations for developers\nof future protected library operating systems.

While knowledge graphs and ontologies are eminently useful to represent\nformal knowledge about a system's individuals and universals, programming\nlanguages are designed to describe the system's evolution. To address this\ndichotomy, we introduce a semantic lifting of the program states of an\nexecuting program into a knowledge graph, for an object-oriented programming\nlanguage.

Recent\ntrends show that the required energy for these datacenters will rise over time,\nor at least remain constant. Hence, the scientific community developed\ndifferent algorithms, architectures, and approaches for improving the energy\nefficiency of cloud datacenters, which are summarized under the umbrella term\nGreen Cloud computing. In this paper, we use an economic approach - taxes - for\nreducing the energy consumption of datacenters. We developed a tax model called\nGreenCloud tax, which penalizes energy-inefficient datacenters while fostering\ndatacenters that are energy-efficient.

In anonymous graphs, vertices are unlabelled, indistinguishable,\nand edges are locally labelled with port numbers. Agents typically rely on\nstationary classical pebbles placed by an oracle to guide their search.\nHowever, this classical approach is constrained by limited information\ntransmission and high traversal complexity. Classical pebbles are not\nsufficient for search if the agents are oblivious. We propose the first use of\nquantum pebbles for search in anonymous graphs. Quantum pebbles periodically\nemit qubits in a fixed quantum state. Each pebble encodes the port number to\nthe next node using a unique quantum state. The agent determines the correct\npath by performing measurements in multiple bases, exploiting the probabilistic\nnature of quantum measurement to distinguish states. We show that this strategy\nenables an oblivious agent to locate the treasure in $D$ steps using $D$\nquantum pebbles, where $D$ is the length of the shortest path between the\nstarting point and the treasure. Moreover, only $O((\\log D + \\log \\Delta)/(\\log\n1/\\delta))$ measurements per node are required to ensure high success\nprobability in a graph with maximum degree $\\Delta$ where $\\delta =\n\\cos^2(\\frac{\\pi}{2\\Delta})$.

We propose Mycroft, a\nlightweight distributed tracing and root cause analysis system designed to\naddress previously hidden reliability issues in collective communication.\nMycroft's key idea is to trace collective communication states and leverage\ninternal control and data dependencies to resolve reliability problems in LLM\ntraining. Mycroft has been deployed at ByteDance for over six months to debug\ncollective communication related issues at runtime. It detected anomalies\nwithin 15 seconds in 90% of cases and identified the root cause within 20\nseconds in 60% of cases.

A major unsolved problem, addressed in this\npaper, is how to devise \\textit{representational-system (RS) agnostic}\ntechniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a\nnovel calculus, called \\textit{structure transfer}, that enables representation\ntransformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a \\textit{source}\nrepresentation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us\nto generate a \\textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of\nstructure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source\nrepresentation and the generated target representation satisfy \\textit{any}\nspecified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting\n\\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can\nexpress \\textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair\nof RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure\nfor the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We\nformalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\\cite{raggi2022rst},\nbuilding on the key concept of a \\textit{construction space}. The abstract\nnature of construction spaces grants them the generality to model RSs of\ndiverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and diagrams, as\nwell as informal notations.

Although it is\nrelatively easy to find inputs that cause a DL model to misbehave, the grouping\nof inputs by features that make the DL model under test fail is largely\nunexplored. Existing approaches for DL testing introduce perturbations that may\nfocus on specific failure-inducing features, while neglecting others that\nbelong to different regions of the feature space. In this paper, we create an\nexplicit topographical map of the input feature space. Our approach, named\nTopoMap, is both black-box and model-agnostic as it relies solely on features\nthat characterise the input space. To discriminate the inputs according to the\nspecific features they share, we first apply dimensionality reduction to obtain\ninput embeddings, which are then subjected to clustering. Each DL model might\nrequire specific embedding computations and clustering algorithms to achieve a\nmeaningful separation of inputs into discriminative groups. We propose a novel\nway to evaluate alternative configurations of embedding and clustering\ntechniques. We used a deep neural network (DNN) as an approximation of a human\nevaluator who could tell whether a pair of clusters can be discriminated based\non the features of the included elements.

First,\nwe find that serverless systems exhibit significant computational overhead due\nto instance churn equivalent to 10-40% of the CPU cycles spent on request\nhandling, primarily originating from worker nodes. Second, we observe high\nmemory allocation due to scaling policy: 2-10 times more than actively used.\nFinally, we demonstrate that reducing these overheads typically results in\nsignificant performance degradation in the current systems, underscoring the\nneed for new, cost-efficient autoscaling strategies.

During training,\nconverting model weights and activations into low-precision formats, i.e.,\nquantization, can drastically reduce training times, energy consumption, and\ncost, and is thus a widely used technique. In this work, we demonstrate that\nquantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD\ncompared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in\nDP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately\nlarge accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a\ndynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of\nlayers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that\neffectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the\nlayers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware\nlayer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity\nestimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model\nquality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy\nbudget, preserving DP guarantees. Empirical evaluations on ResNet18, ResNet50,\nand DenseNet121 across a range of datasets demonstrate that DPQuant\nconsistently outperforms static quantization baselines, achieving near\nPareto-optimal accuracy-compute trade-offs and up to 2.21x theoretical\nthroughput improvements on low-precision hardware, with less than 2% drop in\nvalidation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "DP-SGD\u5728\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0cQPQuant\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5316\u5728DP-SGD\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQPQuant\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6982\u7387\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u5c42\u548c\u635f\u5931\u654f\u611f\u5c42\u4f18\u5148\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "result": "QPQuant\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u635f\u5931\u4f4e\u4e8e2%\u3002", "conclusion": "QPQuant\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u4e86DP-SGD\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u786c\u4ef6\u3002"}}

This\nbecomes especially crucial for challenging long-horizon mobile manipulation\ntasks that require whole-body coordination. We compare two distinct robot\ncontrol paradigms: a coupled embodiment integrating arm manipulation and base\nnavigation functions, and a decoupled embodiment treating these systems as\nseparate control entities. Additionally, we evaluate two visual feedback\nmechanisms: immersive virtual reality and conventional screen-based\nvisualization of the robot's field of view. These configurations were\nsystematically assessed across a complex, multi-stage task sequence requiring\nintegrated planning and execution. Our results show that the use of VR as a\nfeedback modality increases task completion time, cognitive workload, and\nperceived effort of the teleoperator. Coupling manipulation and navigation\nleads to a comparable workload on the user as decoupling the embodiments, while\npreliminary experiments suggest that data acquired by coupled teleoperation\nleads to better imitation learning performance.

For more information, please visit our\n  project website: https://strefer.github.io/", "summary": "Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to\nresolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.\nExisting Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of\ncoarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal\nreasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for\ntemporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object\nreferences and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a\nsynthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs\nwith spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces\ndiverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates\ntemporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and\ntemporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their\nlocations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our\napproach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal\nreferences, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for\nreal-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human\nannotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental\nevaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform\nbaselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,\nthese models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new\nfoundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Strefer\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08Video LLMs\uff09\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u53c2\u8003\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Video LLMs\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9762\u5bf9\u4f9d\u8d56\u65f6\u95f4\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6216\u624b\u52bf\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u3002", "method": "Strefer\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u64ce\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u6574\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f2a\u6807\u6ce8\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u9891\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Strefer\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u6d88\u6b67\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Strefer\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891LLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684AI\u4f34\u4fa3\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}
