We\npropose dedupT, a transformer-based approach that models stack traces\nholistically rather than as isolated frames. dedupT first adapts a pretrained\nlanguage model (PLM) to stack traces, then uses its embeddings to train a\nfully-connected network (FCN) to rank duplicate crashes effectively. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world datasets show that dedupT outperforms existing DL and\ntraditional methods (e.g., sequence alignment and information retrieval\ntechniques) in both duplicate ranking and unique crash detection, significantly\nreducing manual triage effort. On four public datasets, dedupT improves Mean\nReciprocal Rank (MRR) often by over 15% compared to the best DL baseline and up\nto 9% over traditional methods while achieving higher Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC) in detecting unique crash\nreports.

We show that these approaches can be\nseen as part of a design space of morsel dispatching policies based on picking\ndifferent granularities of morsels. We then empirically study the question of\nwhich policies parallelize better in practice under a variety of datasets and\nquery workloads that contain one to many source nodes.

We implement these policies inside a single system, the Kuzu GDBMS,\nand evaluate them both within Kuzu and across other systems. We show that the\nhybrid policy captures the behavior of both source morsel-only and frontier\nmorsel-only policies in cases when these approaches parallelize well, and\nout-perform them on queries when they are limited, and propose it as a robust\napproach to parallelizing recursive queries.

To express concurrent hardware\nbehavior in a sequential language like C/C++, HLS tools introduce constructs\nsuch as infinite loops and dataflow modules connected by FIFOs. However,\nefficiently and accurately simulating these constructs at C level remains\nchallenging. First, without hardware timing information, functional\nverification typically requires slow RTL synthesis and simulation, as the\ncurrent approaches in commercial HLS tools. Second, cycle-accurate performance\nmetrics, such as end-to-end latency, also rely on RTL simulation. No existing\nHLS tool fully overcomes the first limitation. For the second, prior work such\nas LightningSim partially improves simulation speed but lacks support for\nadvanced dataflow features like cyclic dependencies and non-blocking FIFO\naccesses.\n  To overcome both limitations, we propose OmniSim, a framework that\nsignificantly extends the simulation capabilities of both academic and\ncommercial HLS tools. First, OmniSim enables fast and accurate simulation of\ncomplex dataflow designs, especially those explicitly declared unsupported by\ncommercial tools. It does so through sophisticated software multi-threading,\nwhere threads are orchestrated by querying and updating a set of FIFO tables\nthat explicitly record exact hardware timing of each FIFO access. Second,\nOmniSim achieves near-C simulation speed with near-RTL accuracy for both\nfunctionality and performance, via flexibly coupled and overlapped\nfunctionality and performance simulations.\n  We demonstrate that OmniSim successfully simulates eleven designs previously\nunsupported by any HLS tool, achieving up to 35.9x speedup over traditional\nC/RTL co-simulation, and up to 6.61x speedup over the state-of-the-art yet less\ncapable simulator, LightningSim, on its own benchmark suite."}

A common strategy in high-density flash storage is to\nprogram selected blocks in a low-density mode (SLC), sacrificing some capacity\nto achieve higher I/O performance. This hybrid storage architecture has been\nwidely adopted in consumer-grade storage systems. However, existing hybrid\nstorage schemes typically focus on write performance and rely solely on data\ntemperature for migration decisions. This often results in excessive mode\nswitching, causing substantial capacity overhead.\n  In this paper, we present RARO (Reliability-Aware Read performance\nOptimization), a hybrid flash management scheme designed to improve read\nperformance with minimal capacity cost. The key insight behind RARO is that\nmuch of the read slowdown in QLC flash is caused by read retries. RARO triggers\ndata migration only when hot data resides in QLC blocks experiencing a high\nnumber of read retries, significantly reducing unnecessary conversions and\ncapacity loss. Moreover, RARO supports fine-grained multi-mode conversions\n(SLC-TLC-QLC) to further minimize capacity overhead. By leveraging real-time\nread retry statistics and flash characteristics, RARO mitigates over-conversion\nand optimizes I/O performance. Experiments on the FEMU platform demonstrate\nthat RARO significantly improves read performance across diverse workloads,\nwith negligible impact on usable capacity."}

It\nemploys LLMs to decompose complex narrative queries into temporally ordered\nsub-tasks with contextual cues, enabling coherent scene transitions and\nemotional tone consistency. AudioStory has two appealing features: (1)\nDecoupled bridging mechanism: AudioStory disentangles LLM-diffuser\ncollaboration into two specialized components, i.e., a bridging query for\nintra-event semantic alignment and a residual query for cross-event coherence\npreservation. (2) End-to-end training: By unifying instruction comprehension\nand audio generation within a single end-to-end framework, AudioStory\neliminates the need for modular training pipelines while enhancing synergy\nbetween components. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark AudioStory-10K,\nencompassing diverse domains such as animated soundscapes and natural sound\nnarratives.

I argue that a dynamic of AI-derivative\nepistemology, in which individuals increasingly defer to AI outputs, allows a\ncentralized AI Prism to function, a technical mechanism whose architecture is\ndesigned to reduce variance and converge on the statistical mean. This provides\na causal explanation for the generative monocultures observed in recent\nstudies. However, I contend this represents only the first stage of a more\ncomplex and dialectical process. This paper's central and paradoxical thesis is\nthat the very homogenization that flattens knowledge within specialized domains\nsimultaneously renders that knowledge into consistent modules that can be\nrecombined across them, a process foundational to innovation and creativity.\nHowever, this recombinant potential is not automatic, but rather conditional.\nThis paper argues that these opposing forces, homogenizing defaults versus\nrecombinant possibilities, are governed by the nature of human engagement with\nthe technology. The ultimate effect of generative AI is conditional on whether\nindividuals act as passive consumers deferring to the AI's statistical outputs,\nor as active curators who critically interrogate, re-contextualize, and\nrecombine them.

For (a), we show that\noperations required for typical AI workloads can be mapped onto delays,\ncausality, time-outs, packet drop, and broadcast operations -- primitives\nalready implemented in packet-switching and packet-routing hardware. We show\nthat existing buffering and traffic-shaping embedded algorithms can be\nleveraged to implement neuron models and synaptic operations. Additionally, a\nknowledge-distillation framework can train and cross-map well-established\nneural network topologies onto $\\pi^2$ without degrading generalization\nperformance. For (b), analytical modeling shows that, unlike other neuromorphic\nplatforms, the energy scaling of $\\pi^2$ improves with interconnect bandwidth\nand energy efficiency. We predict that by leveraging trends in interconnect\ntechnology, a \\pi^2 architecture can be more easily scaled to execute\nbrain-scale AI inference workloads with power consumption levels in the range\nof hundreds of watts."}

This heterogeneity introduces challenges, as these accelerators and\nDMA-capable devices act as independent bus masters, directly accessing memory.\nConsequently, ensuring both security and timing predictability in such\nenvironments becomes critical. To address these concerns, the Input-Output\nMemory Management Unit (IOMMU) plays a key role in mediating and regulating\nmemory access, preventing unauthorized transactions while enforcing isolation\nand access control policies. While prior work has explored IOMMU-related\nside-channel vulnerabilities from a security standpoint, its role in\nperformance interference remains largely unexplored. Moreover, many of the same\narchitectural properties that enable side-channel leakage, such as shared TLBs,\ncaching effects, and translation overheads, can also introduce timing\nunpredictability. In this work, we analyze the contention effects within IOMMU\nstructures using the Xilinx UltraScale+ ZCU104 platform, demonstrating how\ntheir shared nature introduce unpredictable delays. Our findings reveal that\nIOMMU-induced interference primarily affects small memory transactions, where\ntranslation overheads significantly impact execution time. Additionally, we\nhypothesize that contention effects arising from IOTLBs exhibit similar\nbehavior across architectures due to shared caching principles, such as\nprefetching and hierarchical TLB structures.

Their success hinges on building\ntrust, as employees are often hesitant to share tacit knowledge without\nassurance of confidentiality and appreciation. Key technologies include Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) for generating context-relevant dialogue,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to integrate organizational knowledge, and\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to guide structured reflection. These enable\nSIAs to actively elicit knowledge, uncover implicit assumptions, and connect\ninsights to broader organizational contexts. Potential applications span\nonboarding, where SIAs support personalized guidance and introductions, and\nknowledge retention, where they conduct structured interviews with retiring\nexperts to capture heuristics behind decisions. Success depends on addressing\nethical and operational challenges such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and\nresistance to AI. Transparency, robust validation, and a culture of trust are\nessential to mitigate these risks."}

We present CapTune, a system that enables customization\nof non-speech captions based on DHH viewers' needs while preserving creator\nintent. CapTune allows caption authors to define safe transformation spaces\nusing concrete examples and empowers viewers to personalize captions across\nfour dimensions: level of detail, expressiveness, sound representation method,\nand genre alignment. Evaluations with seven caption creators and twelve DHH\nparticipants showed that CapTune supported creators' creative control while\nenhancing viewers' emotional engagement with content. Our findings also reveal\ntrade-offs between information richness and cognitive load, tensions between\ninterpretive and descriptive representations of sound, and the\ncontext-dependent nature of caption preferences."}

Leveraging\nrecent advancements in commodity drones and photogrammetry, we introduce\nFlyMeThrough -- a drone-based indoor scanning system that efficiently produces\n3D reconstructions of indoor spaces with human-AI collaborative annotations for\nkey indoor points-of-interest (POI) such as entrances, restrooms, stairs, and\nelevators. We evaluated FlyMeThrough in 12 indoor spaces with varying sizes and\nfunctionality. To investigate use cases and solicit feedback from target\nstakeholders, we also conducted a qualitative user study with five building\nmanagers and five occupants. Our findings indicate that FlyMeThrough can\nefficiently and precisely create indoor 3D maps for strategic space planning,\nresource management, and navigation."}

Unlike conventional text-prompt-based generative systems, which\nprimarily capture high-level contextual descriptions, our approach\nsimultaneously analyzes ground-level intuitive geometric features such as line\ntrajectories, proportions, and spatial arrangement, and high-level semantic\ncues extracted via vision-language models. These dual intent signals are\njointly conditioned in a multi-stage generation pipeline that combines\ncontour-preserving structural control with style- and content-aware image\nsynthesis. Implemented with a touchscreen-based interface and distributed\ninference architecture, the system achieves low-latency, two-stage\ntransformation while supporting multi-user collaboration on shared canvases.\nThe resulting platform enables participants, regardless of artistic expertise,\nto engage in synchronous, co-authored visual creation, redefining human-AI\ninteraction as a process of co-creation and mutual enhancement."}

Additionally, we introduce an inference algorithm for learning PARCC\nspecifications via demonstrations.

This article discusses the possibility of a future in\nwhich human beings will have lost or significantly decreased their ability to\nwrite due to the outsourcing of this activity to machines. This possibility\nparallels the loss of the ability to write in other moments of human history,\nsuch as during the so-called Greek Dark Ages (approx. 1200 BCE - 800 BCE)."}

However, the current\nstate-of-the-art learning models do not take into account the student's\naffective states. Multiple studies in educational psychology support the claim\nthat positive or negative emotional states can impact a student's learning\ncapabilities. To bridge this gap, we present MathBuddy, an emotionally aware\nLLM-powered Math Tutor, which dynamically models the student's emotions and\nmaps them to relevant pedagogical strategies, making the tutor-student\nconversation a more empathetic one. The student's emotions are captured from\nthe conversational text as well as from their facial expressions. The student's\nemotions are aggregated from both modalities to confidently prompt our LLM\nTutor for an emotionally-aware response. We have effectively evaluated our\nmodel using automatic evaluation metrics across eight pedagogical dimensions\nand user studies. We report a massive 23 point performance gain using the win\nrate and a 3 point gain at an overall level using DAMR scores which strongly\nsupports our hypothesis of improving LLM-based tutor's pedagogical abilities by\nmodeling students' emotions."}
