Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential\nfor developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for\nmulti-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically\nlack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do\nprovide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability\nlimitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we\ndevelop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more\nscalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of\nsynthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality\nguarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach\nbegins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as\nMulti-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of\nPareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then\nverify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,\nwhich we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach\non a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the\nPareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our\napproach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods\noffering global guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u786e\u4fdd\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5b66\u4e60\u6216\u641c\u7d22\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210Pareto\u6700\u4f18\u5019\u9009\u89e3\u91ca\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7SAT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u63a5\u8fd1\u5177\u6709\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u5408\u6210\u5177\u6709\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

For blind authors, effective interaction with\nCMS platforms requires more than technical compliance; it demands interfaces\ndesigned with semantic clarity, predictable navigation, and meaningful feedback\nfor screen reader users. This study investigates the accessibility barriers\nblind users face when performing key tasks, such as page creation, menu\nediting, and image publishing, using CMS platforms. A two-fold evaluation was\nconducted using automated tools and manual usability testing with three blind\nand one sighted participant, complemented by expert analysis based on the\nBarrier Walkthrough method. Results showed that block-based interfaces were\nparticularly challenging, often marked as accessible by automated tools but\nresulting in critical usability issues during manual evaluation. The use of a\ntext-based editor, the integration of AI-generated image descriptions, and\ntraining aligned with screen reader workflows, significantly improved usability\nand autonomy.

With the advent of 5G networks, which support\nultra-low latency and high bandwidth, streaming high-resolution video at 4K and\nbeyond has become increasingly viable. However, optimizing Quality of\nExperience (QoE) in mobile networks remains challenging due to the complex\ninteractions among Adaptive Bit Rate (ABR) schemes at the application layer, CC\nalgorithms at the transport layer, and Radio Link Control (RLC) queuing at the\nlink layer in the 5G network. While prior studies have largely examined these\ncomponents in isolation, this work presents a comprehensive analysis of the\nimpact of modern active queue management (AQM) strategies, such as RED and L4S,\non video streaming over diverse QUIC implementations--focusing particularly on\ntheir interaction with the RLC buffer in 5G environments and the interplay\nbetween CC algorithms and ABR schemes.

The state-of-the-art\nalgorithm OTCD mitigates redundant computations over overlapping sub-intervals\nby exploiting inclusion relationships among $k$-cores in different time\nintervals. Nevertheless, OTCD remains limited in scalability due to the\ncombinatorial growth in interval enumeration and repeated processing. In this\npaper, we revisit the temporal $k$-core query problem and introduce a novel\nalgorithm CoreT, which dynamically records the earliest timestamp at which each\nvertex or edge enters a $k$-core. This strategy enables substantial pruning of\nredundant computations. As a result, CoreT requires only a single pass over the\nquery interval and achieves improved time complexity, which is linear in both\nthe number of temporal edges within the query interval and the duration of the\ninterval, making it highly scalable for long-term temporal analysis.\nExperimental results on large real-world datasets show that CoreT achieves up\nto four orders of magnitude speedup compared to the existing state-of-the-art\nOTCD, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability for temporal $k$-core\nanalysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCoreT\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u5e8f\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684k-core\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709OTCD\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u65f6\u5e8f\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u7f51\u9875\u94fe\u63a5\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u5f0f\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5206\u6790\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "CoreT\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bb0\u5f55\u9876\u70b9\u6216\u8fb9\u9996\u6b21\u8fdb\u5165k-core\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u6b21\u904d\u5386\u67e5\u8be2\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cCoreT\u5728\u5927\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4OTCD\u5feb\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CoreT\u4e3a\u65f6\u5e8fk-core\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

In a dynamic environment such as the 3D (Edge-Cloud-Space) Compute\nContinuum, serverless functions face additional challenges due to frequent\nchanges in network topology. As satellites move in and out of the range of\nground stations, functions must make multiple hops to access cloud services,\nleading to high-latency state access and unnecessary data transfers. In this\npaper, we present Databelt, a state management framework for serverless\nworkflows designed for the dynamic environment of the 3D Compute Continuum.\nDatabelt introduces an SLO-aware state propagation mechanism that enables the\nfunction state to move continuously in orbit. Databelt proactively offloads\nfunction states to the most suitable node, such that when functions execute,\nthe data is already present on the execution node or nearby, thus minimizing\nstate access latency and reducing the number of network hops. Additionally,\nDatabelt introduces a function state fusion mechanism that abstracts state\nmanagement for functions sharing the same serverless runtime. When functions\nare fused, Databelt seamlessly retrieves their state as a group, reducing\nredundant network and storage operations and improving overall workflow\nefficiency. Our experimental results show that Databelt reduces workflow\nexecution time by up to 66% and increases throughput by 50% compared to the\nbaselines.

However, deploying these PLMs in large-scale applications faces\npractical challenges due to their computational intensity and inference\nlatency. Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and\nacceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge\nfrom large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient\ninference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this\ntechnique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and\ncomputer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains\nlargely underexplored.\n  In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of\nKD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD\nmethods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across\neight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three\ndownstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers\nnotable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared\nwith standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better\neffectiveness as the teacher model.

Big-step semantics also typically involve fewer\ninference rules than their small-step counterparts. However, in exchange for\nergonomics, big-step semantics give up power: Small-step semantics describes\nprogram behaviors that are outside the grasp of big-step semantics, notably\ndivergence. This work presents a little-known extension of big-step semantics\nwith inductive definitions that captures diverging computations without\nintroducing error states.

These collectively\nenhance state vector storage and computational scheduling. The amplitude\npairing mechanism locates relevant amplitude pairs via bitwise XOR, reducing\ntraversal complexity of single-qubit gates from $O(2^n)$ to $O(1)$. Cache\noptimization pre-allocates buffers and loads only required data, cutting disk\nI/O. Block storage optimization partitions the state vector for on-demand\nloading and local updates, reducing redundant access. Parallel optimization\ndistributes the state vector across nodes for collaborative computation,\nachieving near-linear speedup. Complexity analysis shows that, compared with\nhierarchical storage simulation, the method reduces state vector traversals for\nsingle-qubit gates from $2^n$ to 1, removing the main bottleneck. It also\nlowers computational and I/O complexity from $O(2^n)$ to $O(2^n/C)$ and\n$O(2^n/B)$.

In specific, we first construct\na diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with\nheuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus\nwith cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call\ngraphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both\nfile-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a\ntwo-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model.\nFirst, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology.

It is based on a sequence of shellable\ncarrier maps that, starting from a shellable input complex, determine the\nevolution of the protocol complex: During the first t/k rounds, carrier maps\nthat crash exactly k processes per round are used, ensuring high connectivity\nof their images. A Sperner's lemma style argument is used to prove that k-set\nagreement is still impossible by that round. From round t/k+1 up to our lower\nbound, we employ a novel carrier map that maintains high connectivity.

We observe that human navigation\nand movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental\ninteractions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing\nwork does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where\nagent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering\nand fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.\n  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to\ncontrol agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system\nand language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs\nconditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to\ncontrol the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial\nand social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation\nand each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to\ncontrol the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables\nagents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the\nongoing dialogue.\n  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay\nbetween social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we\nobserve that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.\nAdditionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an\ninformation-passing mechanism within the crowd.

Although 3DGS compression methods\nhave been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two\nlimitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to\nthe megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or\nextensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene\nchanges after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an\nImage-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially\nenhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes\nafter archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly\nexploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared\ncodebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to\npreviously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.\nThis approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the\nkilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to\npost-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images\ncaptured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes\nare trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized\nrepresentations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We\nevaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.\nExperimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene\nchanges.

However, their\nsubstantial memory footprint often requires storage on secondary devices, where\nfrequent on-demand loading of graph and vector data leads to I/O becoming the\ndominant bottleneck, accounting for over 90\\% of query latency. Existing static\ncaching strategies mitigate this issue only in the initial navigation phase by\npreloading entry points and multi-hop neighbors, but they fail in the second\nphase where query-dependent nodes must be dynamically accessed to achieve high\nrecall. We propose GoVector, an I/O-efficient caching strategy tailored for\ndisk-based graph indices. GoVector combines (1) a static cache that stores\nentry points and frequently accessed neighbors, and (2) a dynamic cache that\nadaptively captures nodes with high spatial locality during the second search\nphase. To further align storage layout with similarity-driven search patterns,\nGoVector reorders nodes on disk so that similar vectors are colocated on the\nsame or adjacent pages, thereby improving locality and reducing I/O overhead.\nExtensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that GoVector achieves\nsubstantial performance improvements.

Second, we validate our foundation by instantiating it to\na broad range of memory models, including models for C and CHERI. Third,\nwhereas previous memory-model-parametric work has only covered SL analyses, we\ncover both SL and ISL analyses. Fourth, our foundation is based on standard\ndefinitions of SL and ISL (including definitions of function specification\nvalidity, to ensure sound interoperation with other tools and platforms also\nbased on standard definitions).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\uff08CSE\uff09\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u68b0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8986\u76d6SL\u548cISL\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CSE\u5de5\u5177\u867d\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u5206\u79bb\u903b\u8f91\uff08SL\uff09\u548c\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5206\u79bb\u903b\u8f91\uff08ISL\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u5408\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u67e5\u627e\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u57fa\u7840\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7Rocq\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u673a\u68b0\u5316\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982C\u548cCHERI\uff09\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u652f\u6301SL\u548cISL\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u4ec5\u652f\u6301SL\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5b9a\u4e49\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684CSE\u5e73\u53f0\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002"}}

They convert hardware\ndesigns written in description languages such as Verilog into gate-level\nrepresentations for FPGAs. However, defects in these tools may lead to\nunexpected behaviors and pose security risks. Therefore, it is crucial to\nharden these tools through testing. Although several methods have been proposed\nto automatically test FPGA logic synthesis tools, the challenge remains of\ninsufficient semantic and logical complexity in test programs. In this paper,\nwe propose VERMEI, a new method for testing FPGA logic synthesis tools. VERMEI\nconsists of three modules: preprocessing, equivalent mutation, and bug\nidentification. The preprocessing module identifies zombie logic (inactive code\nwith no impact on the circuit output) in seed programs through simulation and\ncoverage analysis. The equivalent mutation module generates equivalent variants\nof seed programs by pruning or inserting logic fragments in zombie areas.

We used\naction research (five action cycles in 16 months) with an IT team that creates\nIT solutions for signal processing. To examine TD awareness, we (1) analyzed\nquestionnaires completed during each workshop, (2) observed team meetings, (3)\nadopted a method from psychology for measuring awareness in decision-making\nsituations called TD-SAGAT, and (4) evaluated the backlog data.

In many cases, their near-real-time\nlatency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate\nadoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the\nfly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,\nreliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational\nadversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated\ndisruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained\ndegradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel\nportfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable\nmulti-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions.

We propose and evaluate modifications to\nthe standard Linux kernel scheduler that mitigate these effects, achieving the\nsame effective performance with a 28% smaller cluster size.

Using\ncross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and\nphilosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim\nis that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of\nbecoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.\nTo address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian\nphilosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the\nAI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and\nindividuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the\nself-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens\npersonalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the\nrecursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by\ninfrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and\ntemporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,\nparticularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and\ndeployment concentrate value and decision-making.
