However, obtaining high-quality\nmeshes of engineering microstructures using these approaches remains an open\nquestion. In harmonic approaches, we usually reconstruct surfaces by evaluating\nthe harmonic bases on equidistantly sampled simplicial complexes of the base\ndomains (e.g., triangular spheroids and disks). However, this traditional\nsampling does not account for local changes in the Jacobian of the basis\nfunctions, resulting in nonuniform discretization after reconstruction or\ngeneration. As it impacts the accuracy and time step, high-quality\ndiscretization of microstructures is crucial for efficient numerical\nsimulations (e.g., finite element and discrete element methods). To circumvent\nthis issue, we propose an efficient hierarchical diffusion-based approach for\nresampling the surface-i.e., performing a reparameterization-to yield an\nequalized mesh triangulation. Analogous to heat problems, we use nonlinear\ndiffusion to resample the curvilinear coordinates of the analysis domain,\nthereby enlarging small triangles at the expense of large triangles on\nsurfaces. We tested isotropic and anisotropic diffusion schemes on the recent\nspheroidal and hemispheroidal harmonics methods.

This model makes these operating\nsystems (OSes) incompatible by design with a large class of software:\nmultiprocess POSIX applications. Indeed, the semantics of the primitive used to\ncreate POSIX processes, fork, are inextricably tied to the existence of\nmultiple address spaces.\n  Prior approaches addressing this issue trade off lightweightness,\ncompatibility and/or isolation. We propose {\\mu}Fork, a single-address-space\noperating system design supporting POSIX fork on modern hardware without\ncompromising on any of these key objectives. {\\mu}Fork emulates POSIX processes\n({\\mu}processes) and achieves fork by creating for the child a copy of the\nparent {\\mu}process' memory at a different location within a single address\nspace. This approach presents two challenges: relocating the child's absolute\nmemory references (pointers), as well as providing user/kernel and\n{\\mu}processes isolation without impacting lightweightness. We address them\nusing CHERI. We implement {\\mu}Fork and evaluate it upon three real-world\nuse-cases: Redis snapshots, Nginx multi-worker deployments, and Zygote FaaS\nworker warm-up. {\\mu}Fork outperforms previous work and traditional monolithic\nOSes on key lightweightness metrics by an order of magnitude, e.g. it can offer\na fork-bound FaaS function throughput 24% higher than that of a monolithic OS,\nand can fork a {\\mu}process in 54{\\mu}s, 3.7x faster than a traditional fork.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u03bcFork\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u652f\u6301POSIX fork\u7684\u5355\u5730\u5740\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CHERI\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u5b58\u5f15\u7528\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u9694\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u5730\u5740\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u5176\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7279\u6027\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0ePOSIX\u591a\u8fdb\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u9694\u79bb\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u03bcFork\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5730\u5740\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u590d\u5236\u7236\u8fdb\u7a0b\u5185\u5b58\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0fork\uff0c\u5229\u7528CHERI\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u6307\u9488\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u9694\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u03bcFork\u5728Redis\u3001Nginx\u548cFaaS\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edffork\u5feb3.7\u500d\uff0c\u51fd\u6570\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u9ad8\u51fa24%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u03bcFork\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u5730\u5740\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7279\u6027\u4e0ePOSIX\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite\nthis proliferation, our understanding of DPIs and their deployments on the\nInternet remains limited -- being network intermediary leaves DPI unresponsive\nto conventional host-based scanning tools, and DPI vendors actively obscuring\ntheir products further complicates measurement efforts.\n  In this work, we present a remote measurement framework, dMAP (DPI Mapper),\nthat derives behavioral fingerprints for DPIs to differentiate and cluster\nthese otherwise indistinguishable middleboxes at scale, as a first step toward\nactive reconnaissance of DPIs on the Internet. Our key insight is that parsing\nand interpreting traffic as network intermediaries inherently involves\nambiguities -- from under-specified protocol behaviors to differing RFC\ninterpretations -- forcing DPI vendors into independent implementation choices\nthat create measurable variance among DPIs. Based on differential fuzzing, dMAP\nsystematically discovers, selects, and deploys specialized probes that\ntranslate DPI internal parsing behaviors into externally observable\nfingerprints. Applying dMAP to DPI deployments globally, we demonstrate its\npractical feasibility, showing that even a modest set of 20-40 discriminative\nprobes reliably differentiates a wide range of DPI implementations, including\nmajor nation-state censorship infrastructures and commercial DPI products.

By integrating the measured quantum\ncorrelations as a central compositional element and synchronizing live visuals\nwith experimental data, the performance offers a unique and unrepeatable\naudiovisual experience that relies on quantum correlations which cannot be\nproduced by any classical device.

Due\nto the computationally-intensive nature of variant calling, genomic data are\nincreasingly processed in cloud environments as large amounts of compute and\nstorage resources can be acquired with the pay-as-you-go pricing model. In this\npaper, we address the problem of efficiently executing a variant calling\npipeline for a workload of human genomes on graphics processing unit\n(GPU)-enabled machines. We propose a novel machine learning (ML)-based approach\nfor optimizing the workload execution to minimize the total execution time. Our\napproach encompasses two key techniques: The first technique employs ML to\npredict the execution times of different stages in a variant calling pipeline\nbased on the characteristics of a genome sequence. Using the predicted times,\nthe second technique generates optimal execution plans for the machines by\ndrawing inspiration from the flexible job shop scheduling problem. The plans\nare executed via careful synchronization across different machines. We\nevaluated our approach on a workload of publicly available genome sequences\nusing a testbed with different types of GPU hardware. We observed that our\napproach was effective in predicting the execution times of variant calling\npipeline stages using ML on features such as sequence size, read quality,\npercentage of duplicate reads, and average read length. In addition, our\napproach achieved 2X speedup (on an average) over a greedy approach that also\nused ML for predicting the execution times on the tested workload of sequences.\nFinally, our approach achieved 1.6X speedup (on an average) over a dynamic\napproach that executed the workload based on availability of resources without\nusing any ML-based time predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728GPU\u673a\u5668\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u6267\u884c\u53d8\u5f02\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d8\u5f02\u68c0\u6d4b\u662f\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u6027\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4f18\u5316GPU\u673a\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d41\u7a0b\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5f02\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d41\u7a0b\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8f66\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u6700\u4f18\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u8d2a\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e862\u500d\u548c1.6\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53d8\u5f02\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In effect, such architectures state how the database records and\nlinks (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical\nexpression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it\nhard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available\ndata to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for\nexplaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where\nexplanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database\nthat mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global\nabductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash,\nSegoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between\ndeterminacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of\ngranularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones\nhighlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of\ntuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case\nof hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive\nsearch over the space of all databases.

We promote resilience by analysing\ndependencies between mobile networks and other critical systems, such as\nenergy, transport, and emergency services, and illustrate how cascading\nfailures spread through infrastructures. We formalise resilience using the 3R\nframework: reliability, robustness, resilience. Subsequently, we translate this\ninto measurable capabilities: graceful degradation, situational awareness,\nrapid reconfiguration, and learning-driven improvement and recovery.\n  Architecturally, we promote edge-native and locality-aware designs, open\ninterfaces, and programmability to enable islanded operations, fallback modes,\nand multi-layer diversity (radio, compute, energy, timing). Key enablers\ninclude AI-native control loops with verifiable behaviour, zero-trust security\nrooted in hardware and supply-chain integrity, and networking techniques that\nprioritise critical traffic, time-sensitive flows, and inter-domain\ncoordination.\n  Resilience also has a techno-economic aspect: open platforms and high-quality\ncomplementors generate ecosystem externalities that enhance resilience while\nopening new markets.

Beyond dataset\nconstruction, we provide the first systematic evaluation of how pre-trained\nlanguage models (PLMs) reason about code modifications -- specifically, which\ninput encodings most effectively expose change information, and whether models\ngenuinely capture edit semantics. We fine-tune CodeBERT, CodeT5+, and UniXcoder\nunder five encoding strategies, and further probe their sensitivity through\ncounterfactual perturbations that swap added/deleted blocks, invert diff\npolarity, or inject spurious markers. Our results show that compact diff-style\nencodings consistently outperform whole-function formats across all PLMs, with\nstatistical tests confirming large, model-independent effects. However, under\ncounterfactual tests, performance degrades little or not at all -- revealing\nthat what appears to be robustness in fact reflects reliance on superficial\ncues rather than true semantic understanding.

We show that when someone sends a warmth-signalling message\n(like thanking or apologizing) without AI help, people more strongly categorize\nthe sender as warm. At the same time, when someone sends a coldness-signalling\nmessage (like bragging or blaming) without assistance, people more confidently\ncategorize them as cold. Interestingly, AI labels weaken both these\nassociations: An AI-assisted apology makes the sender appear less warm than if\nthey had written it themselves, and an AI-assisted blame makes the sender\nappear less cold than if they had composed it independently.

Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered\nin the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,\nsynchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily\non coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,\nlaw enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in\nphysical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit\ncommunication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial\ncoordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and\nadaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative\nonline search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and\nteam members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and\ncoordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by\nmeasuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements\nwithin shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136\nparticipants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.\nResults show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while\nadaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,\nsuggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal\ndynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over\ntime.

This paper argues that practical\nsecurity tools require not only robust backend functionality but also a\nuser-centric design that communicates risk and empowers users to take\nmeaningful action.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86 CryptoGuard\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u94b1\u5305\u7528\u6237\u7684\u524d\u7aef\u5b89\u5168\u4eea\u8868\u76d8\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c AI \u6982\u5ff5\u529f\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u52a0\u5bc6\u52ab\u6301\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u70b9\u51fb\u6a21\u578b\uff08Figma \u539f\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e76\u6574\u5408 AI \u6982\u5ff5\u529f\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u89c9\u8b66\u62a5\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86 CryptoGuard \u539f\u578b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5176\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u6c9f\u901a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1 AI \u529f\u80fd\u5c1a\u5904\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b89\u5168\u5de5\u5177\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u540e\u7aef\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u3002"}}
