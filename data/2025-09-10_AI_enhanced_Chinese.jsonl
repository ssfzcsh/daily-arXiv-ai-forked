Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) is central to formal\nreasoning, yet classical binary resolution remains limited, as each step\ninvolves only two clauses and eliminates at most two literals. To overcome this\nbottleneck, the concept of standard contradiction and the theory of\ncontradiction-separation-based deduction were introduced in 2018. This paper\nadvances that framework by focusing on the systematic construction of standard\ncontradictions. Specially, this study investigates construction methods for two\nprincipal forms of standard contradiction: the maximum triangular standard\ncontradiction and the triangular-type standard contradiction. Building on these\nstructures, we propose a procedure for determining the satisfiability and\nunsatisfiability of clause sets via maximum standard contradiction.\nFurthermore, we derive formulas for computing the number of standard\nsub-contradictions embedded within both the maximum triangular standard\ncontradiction and the triangular-type standard contradiction. The results\npresented herein furnish the methodological basis for advancing\ncontradiction-separation-based dynamic multi-clause automated deduction,\nthereby extending the expressive and deductive capabilities of automated\nreasoning systems beyond the classical binary paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6700\u5927\u4e09\u89d2\u6807\u51c6\u77db\u76fe\u548c\u4e09\u89d2\u578b\u6807\u51c6\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u6807\u51c6\u77db\u76fe\u5224\u65ad\u5b50\u53e5\u96c6\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6807\u51c6\u5b50\u77db\u76fe\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u77db\u76fe\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u5b50\u53e5\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u514b\u670d\u7ecf\u5178\u4e8c\u5143\u5f52\u7ed3\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u52a0\u900f\u660e\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u79cd\u6807\u51c6\u77db\u76fe\uff08\u6700\u5927\u4e09\u89d2\u6807\u51c6\u77db\u76fe\u548c\u4e09\u89d2\u578b\u6807\u51c6\u77db\u76fe\uff09\u7684\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u6807\u51c6\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u5b50\u53e5\u96c6\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u5224\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6807\u51c6\u5b50\u77db\u76fe\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u5b50\u53e5\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u4e8c\u5143\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing methods in this field primarily\nsupport tactical decision-making, where simulations start from an empty state\nand aim to estimate the long-term effects of process changes. A complementary\nuse-case is operational decision-making, where the goal is to forecast\nshort-term performance based on ongoing cases and to analyze the impact of\ntemporary disruptions, such as demand spikes and shortfalls in available\nresources. An approach to tackle this use-case is to run a long-term simulation\nup to a point where the workload is similar to the current one (warm-up), and\nmeasure performance thereon. However, this approach does not consider the\ncurrent state of ongoing cases and resources in the process. This paper studies\nan alternative approach that initializes the simulation from a representation\nof the current state derived from an event log of ongoing cases. The paper\naddresses two challenges in operationalizing this approach: (1) Given a\nsimulation model, what information is needed so that a simulation run can start\nfrom the current state of cases and resources? (2) How can the current state of\na process be derived from an event log? The resulting short-term simulation\napproach is embodied in a simulation engine that takes as input a simulation\nmodel and a log of ongoing cases, and simulates cases for a given time horizon.\nAn experimental evaluation shows that this approach yields more accurate\nshort-term performance forecasts than long-term simulations with warm-up\nperiod, particularly in the presence of concept drift or bursty performance\npatterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d41\u7a0b\u4eff\u771f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5f53\u524d\u72b6\u6001\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4eff\u771f\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u77ed\u671f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4eff\u771f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u652f\u6301\u6218\u672f\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u64cd\u4f5c\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u4e34\u65f6\u4e2d\u65ad\uff08\u5982\u9700\u6c42\u5cf0\u503c\u6216\u8d44\u6e90\u77ed\u7f3a\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65e5\u5fd7\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5f53\u524d\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4eff\u771f\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u6216\u7a81\u53d1\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u77ed\u671f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u4eff\u771f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u64cd\u4f5c\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Akan"], "title": "Gut-Brain Axis as a Closed-Loop Molecular Communication Network", "categories": ["cs.ET"], "comment": null, "summary": "Molecular communication (MC) provides a quantitative framework for analyzing\ninformation transfer within biological systems. This paper introduces a novel\nand comprehensive MC framework for the gut-brain axis (GBA) as a system of six\ncoupled, nonlinear delay differential equations (DDEs). The proposed model\ndefines a bidirectional feedback loop with a gut-to-brain inflammatory channel\nand a brain-to-gut neuroendocrine channel. Under prolonged stress, this\nfeedback loop becomes self-perpetuating and drives the system into a\npathological state. We evaluate the end-to-end channel across varying\nconditions using time-domain simulations, small-signal frequency-domain\ncharacterization, and an information-theoretic capacity analysis.

A\nconsistent agreement on the roster is established through roster leases, an\nall-to-all leasing mechanism that generalizes existing all-to-one leasing\napproaches (Leader Leases, Quorum Leases), unlocking a new point in the\nprotocol design space. Bodega further employs optimistic holding and early\naccept notifications to minimize interruption from interfering writes, and\nincorporates smart roster coverage and lightweight heartbeats to maximize\npracticality. Bodega is a non-intrusive extension to classic consensus; it\nimposes no special requirements on writes other than a responder-covering\nquorum.

The compute continuum emerges as a promising solution, enabling\nflexible deployment of microservices across distributed, heterogeneous domains.\nHowever, this paradigm also requires a novel approach to resource allocation\nand service placement, as traditional centralized solutions struggle to scale\neffectively, suffer from latency bottlenecks, and introduce single points of\nfailure. In this paper, we present DREAMS, a decentralized framework that\noptimizes microservice placement decisions collaboratively across different\ncomputational domains. At its core, DREAMS introduces agents that operate\nautonomously within each domain while coordinating globally through a\nRaft-based consensus algorithm and cost-benefit voting.

We propose a novel\nyet efficient method to compute Voronoi diagrams bounded by a given domain,\ni.e., the clipped or restricted Voronoi diagrams. The intersection of the\ndomain and a Voronoi cell (domain-cell intersection) is generated by removing\nthe part outside the cell from the domain, which can be accomplished by several\nclippings. Different from the existing methods, we present an edge-based search\nscheme to find clipping planes (bisectors). A test called point-in-cell is\nfirst set up to tell whether a space point is in a target Voronoi cell or not.\nThen, for each edge of the intermediate domain-cell intersection, we will\nlaunch a clipping only if its two endpoints are respectively inside and outside\nthe corresponding Voronoi cell, where the bisector for the clipping can be\nfound by using a few times of point-in-cell tests. Therefore, our method only\ninvolves the clippings that contribute to the final results, which is a great\nadvantage over the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, because each\ndomain-cell intersection can be generated independently, we extend the proposed\nmethod to the GPUs for computing Voronoi diagrams in parallel.

However, their expressiveness has been insufficient for\ntracking capabilities embedded in generic data structures, preventing them from\nscaling to the standard collections library -- an essential prerequisite for\nbroader adoption. This limitation stems from the inability to name capabilities\nwithin the system's notion of box types.\n  This paper develops System Capless, a new foundation for capturing types that\nprovides the theoretical basis for reach capabilities (rcaps), a novel\nmechanism for naming \"what's in the box.\" The calculus refines the universal\ncapability notion into a new scheme with existential and universal capture set\nquantification. Intuitively, rcaps witness existentially quantified capture\nsets inside the boxes of generic types in a way that does not require exposing\nexistential capture types in the surface language. We have fully mechanized the\nformal metatheory of System Capless in Lean, including proofs of type soundness\nand scope safety. System Capless supports the same lightweight notation of\ncapturing types plus rcaps, as certified by a type-preserving translation, and\nalso enables fully optional explicit capture-set quantification to increase\nexpressiveness.\n  Finally, we present a full reimplementation of capture checking in Scala 3\nbased on System Capless and migrate the entire Scala collections library and an\nasynchronous programming library to evaluate its practicality and ergonomics.\nOur results demonstrate that reach capabilities enable the adoption of capture\nchecking in production code with minimal changes and minimal-to-zero notational\noverhead in a vast majority of cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "System Capless\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86Scala\u4e2d\u7684\u6355\u83b7\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165reach capabilities\uff08rcaps\uff09\u6765\u547d\u540d\u6cdb\u578b\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eScala\u6807\u51c6\u5e93\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e93\u4e2d\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Scala\u6355\u83b7\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6cdb\u578b\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSystem Capless\uff0c\u5f15\u5165rcaps\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b58\u5728\u548c\u5168\u79f0\u6355\u83b7\u96c6\u91cf\u5316\u547d\u540d\u6cdb\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Lean\u4e2d\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "System Capless\u652f\u6301\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53ea\u9700\u6700\u5c0f\u6539\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "rcaps\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6355\u83b7\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u751f\u4ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u3002"}}

Such\ndistributions concentrate radiative energy within a narrow lobe and are highly\nsensitive to changes in view direction. However, existing neural radiosity\nmethods, which primarily rely on positional feature encoding, exhibit notable\nlimitations in capturing these high-frequency, strongly view-dependent radiance\ndistributions.

Electronic-photonic\nintegrated circuits (EPICs) have emerged as a compelling platform for\nnext-generation AI systems, offering inherent advantages in ultra-high\nbandwidth, low latency, and energy efficiency for computing and\ninterconnection. Beyond performance, EPICs also hold unique promises for\nsustainability. Fabricated in relaxed process nodes with fewer metal layers and\nlower defect densities, photonic devices naturally reduce embodied carbon\nfootprint (CFP) compared to advanced digital electronic integrated circuits,\nwhile delivering orders-of-magnitude higher computing performance and\ninterconnect bandwidth. To further advance the sustainability of photonic AI\nsystems, we explore how electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) and\ncross-layer co-design methodologies can amplify these inherent benefits. We\npresent how advanced EPDA tools enable more compact layout generation, reducing\nboth chip area and metal layer usage.

By uniting intrinsic photonic efficiency with\nEPDA- and co-design-driven gains in area efficiency, reconfigurability, and\nrobustness, we outline a vision for lifelong-sustainable electronic-photonic AI\nsystems.

This leaves\napplications with the complex choice of embedding logic as RPC handlers at\nservers, using RDMA's limited interface to access server structures via\nclient-side logic, or running some logic on SmartNICs. The best choice varies\nbetween workloads and over time. To solve this dilemma, we present NAAM,\nnetwork-accelerated active messages.

NAAM runs at various places in the\nnetwork, including at clients, on server-attached SmartNICs, and server host\nCPU cores. Due to eBPF's portability, the code associated with a message can be\nrun at any location. Hence, the NAAM runtime can dynamically steer any message\nto execute its associated logic wherever it makes the most sense. To\ndemonstrate NAAM's flexibility, we built several applications, including the\nMICA hash table and lookups from a Cell-style B-tree.

However, robustly modeling general\ndynamic scenes, especially those involving topological changes while\nmaintaining long-term tracking remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper,\nwe present TaoGS, a novel topology-aware dynamic Gaussian representation that\ndisentangles motion and appearance to support, both, long-range tracking and\ntopological adaptation. We represent scene motion with a sparse set of motion\nGaussians, which are continuously updated by a spatio-temporal tracker and\nphotometric cues that detect structural variations across frames. To capture\nfine-grained texture, each motion Gaussian anchors and dynamically activates a\nset of local appearance Gaussians, which are non-rigidly warped to the current\nframe to provide strong initialization and significantly reduce training time.\nThis activation mechanism enables efficient modeling of detailed textures and\nmaintains temporal coherence, allowing high-fidelity rendering even under\nchallenging scenarios such as changing clothes. To enable seamless integration\ninto codec-based volumetric formats, we introduce a global Gaussian Lookup\nTable that records the lifespan of each Gaussian and organizes attributes into\na lifespan-aware 2D layout. This structure aligns naturally with standard video\ncodecs and supports up to 40 compression.

We finally identify various open research\nchallenges, including studying of (i) inter-institution heterogeneous privacy\nregulations, (ii) the non-uniformity of data modalities' characteristics, (iii)\nthe unlearning approaches for M3T FedFMs, (iv) the continual learning\nframeworks for M3T FedFMs, and (v) M3T FedFM model interpretability, which must\nbe collectively addressed for practical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff08M3T FedFMs\uff09\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u5230\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5b64\u5c9b\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u53c8\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faM3T FedFMs\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5206\u6563\u673a\u6784\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "M3T FedFMs\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u63a8\u52a8\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u667a\u80fd\u6559\u80b2\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "M3T FedFMs\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u9690\u79c1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

While it\nstrongly supports configurable consensus and access control, Fabric can face\nchallenges in achieving high transaction throughput and low rejection rates\nunder heavy workloads. These performance limitations are often attributed to\nendorsement, ordering, and validation bottlenecks. Further, optimistic\nconcurrency control and deferred validation in Fabric may lead to resource\ninefficiencies and contention, as conflicting transactions are identified only\nduring the commit phase. To address these challenges, we propose a\ndependency-aware execution model for Hyperledger Fabric. Our approach includes:\n(a) a dependency flagging system during endorsement, marking transactions as\nindependent or dependent using a hashmap; (b) an optimized block construction\nin the ordering service that prioritizes independent transactions; (c) the\nincorporation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) within each block to represent\ndependencies; and (d) parallel execution of independent transactions at the\ncommitter, with dependent transactions processed according to DAG order.\nIncorporated in Hyperledger Fabric v2.5, our framework was tested on workloads\nwith varying dependency levels and system loads. Results show up to 40% higher\nthroughput and significantly reduced rejection rates in high-contention\nscenarios. This demonstrates that dependency-aware scheduling and DAG-based\nexecution can substantially enhance Fabric's scalability while remaining\ncompatible with its existing consensus and smart contract layers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u611f\u77e5\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316Hyperledger Fabric\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u5fd7\u4ea4\u6613\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u533a\u5757\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "Hyperledger Fabric\u5728\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4ea4\u6613\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u4f4e\u6548\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u5176\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u5fd7\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u533a\u5757\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u4f7f\u7528DAG\u8868\u793a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728Fabric v2.5\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe40%\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u9ad8\u7ade\u4e89\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f9d\u8d56\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u548cDAG\u6267\u884c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Fabric\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u6709\u5171\u8bc6\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u5c42\u3002"}}

However, in\nstudio-based design courses, students often struggle to provide feedback due to\na lack of confidence and fear of being judged, which limits their ability to\ndevelop essential feedback-giving skills. Recent advances in large language\nmodels (LLMs) suggest that role-playing with AI agents can let learners engage\nin multi-turn feedback without the anxiety of external judgment or the time\nconstraints of real-world settings. Yet prior studies have raised concerns that\nLLMs struggle to behave like real people in role-play scenarios, diminishing\nthe educational benefits of these interactions. Therefore, designing AI-based\nagents that effectively support learners in practicing and developing\nintellectual reasoning skills requires more than merely assigning the target\npersona's personality and role to the agent. By addressing these issues, we\npresent Feed-O-Meter, a novel system that employs carefully designed LLM-based\nagents to create an environment in which students can practice giving design\nfeedback. The system enables users to role-play as mentors, providing feedback\nto an AI mentee and allowing them to reflect on how that feedback impacts the\nAI mentee's idea development process. A user study (N=24) indicated that\nFeed-O-Meter increased participants' engagement and motivation through\nrole-switching and helped them adjust feedback to be more comprehensible for an\nAI mentee.

It supports two types of regenerative payload,\non-board gNB and on-board gNB-Distributed Unit (gNB-DU). Measurement results\nbased on our prototype implementation show that the on-board gNB offers lower\nlatency, while the on-board gNB-DU is more cost-effective, and there is often a\ntrade-off between Quality-of-Service (QoS) and operational expenditure (OPEX)\nwhen choosing between the two payload types. However, current SAN\nconfigurations are static and inflexible -- either deploying the full on-board\ngNB or only the on-board gNB-DU. This rigidity can lead to resource waste or\npoor user experiences. In this paper, we propose Flexible SAN (FlexSAN), an\nadaptive satellite access network architecture that dynamically configures the\noptimal regenerative payload based on real-time user demands.

However, their combination with existing congestion control\nalgorithms (CCAs) may lead to poor performance, and even state-of-the-art CCAs\ncan collapse due to duplicate ACKs. A typical approach to handle this collapse\nis to make CCAs resilient to duplicate ACKs.\n  In this paper, we first model the throughput collapse of a wide array of CCAs\nwhen some of the paths are congested. We show that addressing duplicate ACKs is\ninsufficient. Instead, we explain that since CCAs are typically designed for\nsingle-path routing, their estimation function focuses on the latest feedback\nand mishandles feedback that reflects multiple paths. We propose to use a\nmedian feedback that is more robust to the varying signals that come with\nmultiple paths. We introduce MSwift, which applies this principle to make\nGoogle's Swift robust to multi-path routing while keeping its incast tolerance\nand single-path performance.

Twenty participants\ncompleted a 360{\\deg} cube-selection task using three different input methods:\nVR controllers, gaze combined with a pinch gesture, and NeuroGaze. Performance\nwas measured by task completion time and error rate, while workload was\nevaluated using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX).

In practice, accelerated approximations are employed to handle\nvery large datasets. Accelerating NE is challenging, and two main directions\nhave been explored: very coarse approximations based on negative sampling (as\nin UMAP) achieve high effective speed but may lack quality in the extracted\nstructures; less coarse approximations, as used in FIt-SNE or BH-t-SNE, offer\nbetter structure preservation at the cost of speed, while also restricting the\ntarget dimensionality to 2 or 3, limiting NE to visualisation. In some\nvariants, the precision of these costlier accelerations also enables\nfiner-grained control on the extracted structures through dedicated\nhyperparameters.\n  This paper proposes to bridge the gab between both approaches by introducing\na novel way to accelerate NE, requiring a small number of computations per\niteration while maintaining good fine-grained structure preservation and\nflexibility through hyperparameter tuning, without limiting the dimensionality\nof the embedding space. The method was designed for interactive exploration of\ndata; as such, it abandons the traditional two-phased approach of other NE\nmethods, allowing instantaneous visual feedback when changing hyperparameters,\neven when these control processes happening on the high-dimensional side of the\ncomputations. Experiments using a publicly available, GPU accelerated GUI\nintegration of the method show promising results in terms of speed, flexibility\nin the structures getting extracted, and show potential uses in broader machine\nlearning contexts with minimal algorithmic modifications.

While\nthe intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty\nin human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely\nassumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs.\nThis raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to\ninstruction changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered\nproblematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness\ncorrectly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we\nsystematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and\nidentical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the\nquestion of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To\nstudy this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification\ntasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans\nand LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt\nmodifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative\nlabel sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is\nless affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of\nLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u5bf9\u6307\u4ee4\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4fee\u6539\u4e0b\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8106\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u62fc\u5199\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u987a\u5e8f\u53cd\u8f6c\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8106\u6027\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u884c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5224\u65ad\u8fd9\u79cd\u8106\u6027\u662f\u5426\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u63d0\u793a\u4fee\u6539\u5bf9LLM\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4e24\u8005\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u4fee\u6539\uff08\u5982\u6807\u7b7e\u96c6\u6216\u683c\u5f0f\u66ff\u6362\uff09\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8106\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u62fc\u5199\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u987a\u5e8f\u53cd\u8f6c\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u66f4\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8106\u6027\u90e8\u5206\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u3002"}}
