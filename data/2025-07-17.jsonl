Architectural patterns and\nstrategies can provide reusable knowledge and best practices to engineer\nquantum software systems effectively and efficiently. However, quantum software\npractitioners face significant challenges in selecting and implementing\nappropriate patterns and strategies due to the complexity of quantum software\nsystems and the lack of guidelines. To address these challenges, this study\nproposes decision models for selecting patterns and strategies in six critical\ndesign areas in quantum software systems: Communication, Decomposition, Data\nProcessing, Fault Tolerance, Integration and Optimization, and Algorithm\nImplementation. These decision models are constructed based on data collected\nfrom both a mining study (i.e., GitHub and Stack Exchange) and a Systematic\nLiterature Review, which were used to identify relevant patterns and strategies\nwith their involved Quality Attributes (QAs). We then conducted semi-structured\ninterviews with 16 quantum software practitioners to evaluate the familiarity,\nunderstandability, completeness, and usefulness of the proposed decision\nmodels. The results show that the proposed decision models can aid\npractitioners in selecting suitable patterns and strategies to address the\nchallenges related to the architecture design of quantum software systems.

We see that the\nfraction of IPv6 traffic a user sends varies greatly, both across users and\nday-by-day, with a standard deviation of over 15%. We show this variation\noccurs for two main reasons.

The introduction of optical switches in DCNs as a future-proof\nsolution exacerbates this problem due to several properties of optical\nswitches, such as the fact that they are generally bufferless and therefore\nrely on centralized scheduling, and that they have long switching times and\ntherefore require the number of rearrangements to be minimized.\n  In this paper, we propose a centralized scheduling algorithm that achieves\ntheoretical maximum throughput even in one-rate bidirectional Clos networks,\nwhile producing schemes with near-minimal numbers of rearrangements. It is the\nonly algorithm that directly supports bidirectional Clos networks and has a\ntime efficiency high enough to support dynamic scheduling to date. For static\nminimal rewiring, its running time ranges from a fraction to a few hundredths\nof other algorithms, and the number of rearrangements has also been steadily\nimproved, allowing for more frequent adjustments and less impact on ongoing\ncommunications.

To address\nthese limitations, we propose Envisage, an interactive visual graph querying\nsystem to enhance the expressiveness of VGQ in complex query scenarios by\nsupporting intuitive graph structure construction and flexible parameterized\nrule specification. Specifically, Envisage comprises four stages: Query\nExpression allows users to interactively construct graph queries through\nintuitive operations; Query Verification enables the validation of constructed\nqueries via rule verification and query instantiation; Progressive Query\nExecution can progressively execute queries to ensure meaningful querying\nresults; and Result Analysis facilitates result exploration and interpretation.\nTo evaluate Envisage, we conducted two case studies and in-depth user\ninterviews with 14 graph analysts.

Leveraging temporally correlated input\nfrom consecutive film frames, we employ temporal convolutional layers in our\narchitecture, which effectively allows to bridge the temporal resolution gap\nbetween natural movie stimuli and fMRI acquisitions. Our model predicts\nactivity of voxels in and around the visual cortex and performs reconstruction\nof corresponding visual inputs from neural activity. Finally, we investigate\nbrain regions contributing to visual decoding through saliency maps. We find\nthat the most contributing regions are the middle occipital area, the fusiform\narea, and the calcarine, respectively employed in shape perception, complex\nrecognition (in particular face perception), and basic visual features such as\nedges and contrasts. These functions being strongly solicited are in line with\nthe decoder's capability to reconstruct edges, faces, and contrasts. All in\nall, this suggests the possibility to probe our understanding of visual\nprocessing in films using as a proxy the behaviour of deep learning models such\nas the one proposed in this paper."}

Traditional methods often rely on\nmonomodal approaches, focusing on single types of interactions like co-retweets\nor co-hashtags, or consider multiple modalities independently of each other.\nHowever, these approaches may overlook the complex dynamics inherent in\nmultimodal coordination. This study compares different ways of operationalizing\nthe detection of multimodal coordinated behavior. It examines the trade-off\nbetween weakly and strongly integrated multimodal models, highlighting the\nbalance between capturing broader coordination patterns and identifying tightly\ncoordinated behavior. By comparing monomodal and multimodal approaches, we\nassess the unique contributions of different data modalities and explore how\nvarying implementations of multimodality impact detection outcomes. Our\nfindings reveal that not all the modalities provide distinct insights, but that\nwith a multimodal approach we can get a more comprehensive understanding of\ncoordination dynamics. This work enhances the ability to detect and analyze\ncoordinated online behavior, offering new perspectives for safeguarding the\nintegrity of digital platforms."}

One fundamental aspect of human-machine interaction is the concept of\nweb usability. In order to assess web usability, the A/B testing technique\nenables the comparison of data between two designs. Expanding the scope of\ntests to include the designs being evaluated, in conjunction with the\ninvolvement of both real and fictional users, presents a challenge for which\nfew online tools offer support. We propose a methodology for web usability\nevaluation based on user-centered approaches such as design thinking and\nlinguistic decision-making, named Linguistic Decision-Making for Web Usability\nEvaluation. This engages people in role-playing scenarios and conducts a number\nof usability tests, including the widely recognized System Usability Scale. We\nincorporate the methodology into a decision support system based on A/B\ntesting. We use real users in a case study to assess three Moodle platforms at\nthe University of Guadalajara, Mexico."}

This study reveals a\ngender bias in the perception of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) speech. In a\nperception experiment involving 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese\nand Greek speech, we identified that male speech was more frequently identified\nas AD, with this bias being particularly pronounced in Chinese speech. Acoustic\nanalysis showed that shimmer values in male speech were significantly\nassociated with AD perception, while speech portion exhibited a significant\nnegative correlation with AD identification. Although language did not have a\nsignificant impact on AD perception, our findings underscore the critical role\nof gender bias in AD speech perception. This work highlights the necessity of\naddressing gender bias when developing AD detection models and calls for\nfurther research to validate model performance across different linguistic\ncontexts."}

However, they face challenges such as\nambiguity in user requests processed by LLMs. To address these challenges, this\npaper introduces and evaluates a multi-agent debate framework designed to\nenhance detection and resolution capabilities beyond single models. The\nframework consists of three LLM architectures (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, and\nMistral-7B variants) and a dataset with diverse ambiguities. The debate\nframework markedly enhanced the performance of Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B\nvariants over their individual baselines, with Mistral-7B-led debates achieving\na notable 76.7% success rate and proving particularly effective for complex\nambiguities and efficient consensus. While acknowledging varying model\nresponses to collaborative strategies, these findings underscore the debate\nframework's value as a targeted method for augmenting LLM capabilities. This\nwork offers important insights for developing more robust and adaptive language\nunderstanding systems by showing how structured debates can lead to improved\nclarity in interactive systems."}

We illustrate the ambiguity problem in a networking\ncontext for LLM-based incremental configuration synthesis of route-maps and\nACLs. These structures frequently overlap in header space, making the relative\npriority of actions impossible for the LLM to infer without user interaction.\nMeasurements in a large cloud identify complex ACLs with 100's of overlaps,\nshowing ambiguity is a real problem. We propose a prototype system, Clarify,\nwhich uses an LLM augmented with a new module called a Disambiguator that helps\nelicit user intent. On a small synthetic workload, Clarify incrementally\nsynthesizes routing policies after disambiguation and then verifies them. Our\ntreatment of ambiguities is useful more generally when the intent of updates\ncan be correctly synthesized by LLMs, but their integration is ambiguous and\ncan lead to different global behaviors."}
