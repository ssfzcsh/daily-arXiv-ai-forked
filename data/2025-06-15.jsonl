However, many existing methods rely solely on\nsingle-modal data (e.g., metrics, logs, and traces) and struggle to\nsimultaneously address multiple downstream tasks, including anomaly detection\n(AD), failure triage (FT), and root cause localization (RCL). Moreover, the\nlack of clear reasoning evidence in current techniques often leads to\ninsufficient interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose\nTrioXpert, an end-to-end incident management framework capable of fully\nleveraging multimodal data. TrioXpert designs three independent data processing\npipelines based on the inherent characteristics of different modalities,\ncomprehensively characterizing the operational status of microservice systems\nfrom both numerical and textual dimensions. It employs a collaborative\nreasoning mechanism using large language models (LLMs) to simultaneously handle\nmultiple tasks while providing clear reasoning evidence to ensure strong\ninterpretability. We conducted extensive evaluations on two popular\nmicroservice system datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that\nTrioXpert achieves outstanding performance in AD (improving by 4.7% to 57.7%),\nFT (improving by 2.1% to 40.6%), and RCL (improving by 1.6% to 163.1%) tasks."}

The core contribution of this work on HOLMS is the development of a\nunified and modular strategy for proving adequacy theorems with respect to\nrelational semantics directly within HOL Light for several normal modal\nsystems, currently including K, T, K4, and GL. Adequacy theorems establish a\nformal connection between syntactic proof systems and their intended relational\nmodels, ensuring that derivable statements align with valid ones.

The surface\ncode, known for its high resilience to physical errors, is a leading candidate\nfor fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Logical qubits encoded with the\nsurface code can be in different phases of their syndrome generation cycle,\nthereby introducing desynchronization in the system. This can occur due to the\nproduction of non-Clifford states, dropouts due to fabrication defects, and the\nuse of other QEC codes with the surface code to reduce resource requirements.\nLogical operations require the syndrome generation cycles of the logical qubits\ninvolved to be synchronized. This requires the leading qubit to pause or slow\ndown its cycle, allowing more errors to accumulate before the next cycle,\nthereby increasing the risk of uncorrectable errors.\n  To synchronize the syndrome generation cycles of logical qubits, we define\nthree policies - Passive, Active, and Hybrid. The Passive policy is the\nbaseline, and the simplest, wherein the leading logical qubits idle until they\nare synchronized with the remaining logical qubits. On the other hand, the\nActive policy aims to slow the leading logical qubits down gradually, by\ninserting short idle periods before multiple code cycles. This approach reduces\nthe logical error rate (LER) by up to 2.4x compared to the Passive policy. The\nHybrid policy further reduces the LER by up to 3.4x by reducing the\nsynchronization slack and running a few additional rounds of error correction.\nFurthermore, the reduction in the logical error rate with the proposed\nsynchronization policies enables a speedup in decoding latency of up to 2.2x\nwith a circuit-level noise model."}

Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such\nas large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly\nintegrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences.\nDespite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies\ninfluence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based\napplications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what\nforms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation\nmethodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of\n30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains\nincluding storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence,\ncollaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight\nthe role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective\ntechnology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical\nconcerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the\npotential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls\nfor greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation\nstrategies."}

These partial computation\nsteps can enable pebbling strategies with much smaller I/O cost, and in\nsettings where such a step-by-step aggregation is possible, this extended\nred-blue pebble game offers a much more realistic cost model.\n  We establish the fundamental properties of this partial-computing red-blue\npebble game (PRBP), and compare it to the original RBP.

However, how users perceive, evaluate, and\ncritique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the\noverwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first\ncomprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps,\nleveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with\n894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a\nmulti-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and\nsystematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.\nEach stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and\nclustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables\nscalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million\naspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.\nOur analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:\npositive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized\nassistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,\nscanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language\nsupport. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and\nfrustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained,\nco-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat\npositive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.\nTo this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world\nuser experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers\nboth universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations."}

CIDer integrates two key components: a\nModel-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal\nInference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a\nweight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,\nattention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level\nSelf-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a\nMultimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.\nTo tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate\nlabel and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and\nfine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD\ngeneralization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also\nintroduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets.

Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to\nthe semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract\ncues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the\nphysical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple\nplausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional\nguidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse\ndance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired\nmusic and dance data, which restricts the model\\^a\\u{A}\\'Zs ability to learn\ndiverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language\nModel (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a\nchoreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,\nhigh-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit\nlearning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both\nmore diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of\nthree components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that\nproduces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a\nmulti-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,\nand textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based\nmotion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which\nensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.\nExtensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively."}

Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show\nthat our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,\nwith GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per\ninstance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at\nthe lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our\nexit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,\nand our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall\nof 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of\nlarge-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training\nand evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at\nhttps://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory."}

Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if\nit is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other\nwords, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The\nresulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending\nnumber-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender\nsequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for\ninterpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer\nhidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic\nat scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender\nsequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it,\nthe difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We\ndesign a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis\nacross multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek,\nGemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying\nrule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the\nsequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis\nevaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to\nassess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct\nand a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning,\nhypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains\nof number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering."}

Yet, despite recent advances,\ntheir output often suffers from syntactic and semantic errors and remains\ndifficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs),\nresearchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output.\nNevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations,\nsuch as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation.\nIn this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that\nharnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via\nreinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving\naccuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of\ndecompiled code: \\textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}.\nCentral to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system\nto score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle,\nD-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher\nscores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically,\nD-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler\nand symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then\nevaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with\nthe original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for\nfine-tuning. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs,\ndemonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the\ncoreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without\nD-SCORE-driven fine-tuning, D-LiFT produces 55.3% more improved decompiled\nfunctions, as measured by D-SCORE."}

At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels\nthe synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance.\nCompared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of\nreal-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2)\nsynthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and\nsemantic constraints in a human-understandable way.
