However, existing methods\nfocus primarily on geometric and appearance modeling, lacking deeper scene\nunderstanding while also incurring high training costs that complicate the\noriginally streamlined differentiable rendering pipeline. To this end, we\npropose VoteSplat, a novel 3D scene understanding framework that integrates\nHough voting with 3DGS. Specifically, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized\nfor instance segmentation, extracting objects, and generating 2D vote maps. We\nthen embed spatial offset vectors into Gaussian primitives. These offsets\nconstruct 3D spatial votes by associating them with 2D image votes, while depth\ndistortion constraints refine localization along the depth axis.

Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate effectiveness of VoteSplat in open-vocabulary 3D\ninstance localization, 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D object\nlocalization, hierarchical segmentation, and ablation studies.

We acknowledge the danger in\nbreaking the golden law of user-kernel address space isolation, so we coupled a\nuBPF VM (user-space BPF Virtual Machine) with shared memory to control access\nto the kernel's memory from the user's application. In this case, user-space\nprograms can access the shared memory under the supervision of the uBPF VM (and\nthe kernel's blessing of its shared library) to gain non-blocking data transfer\nto and from the kernel's memory space.

Modern accelerators are commonly\nequipped with Tensor cores and CUDA cores to accelerate sparse operators. The\nformer brings superior computing power but only for structured matrix\nmultiplication, while the latter has relatively lower performance but with\nhigher programming flexibility. In this work, we discover that utilizing one\nresource alone leads to inferior performance for sparse matrix multiplication,\ndue to their respective limitations. To this end, we propose Libra, a\nsystematic approach that enables synergistic computation between CUDA and\nTensor cores to achieve the best performance for sparse matrix multiplication.\nSpecifically, we propose a 2D-aware workload distribution strategy to find out\nthe sweet point of task mapping for different sparse operators, leveraging both\nthe high performance of Tensor cores and the low computational redundancy on\nCUDA cores.

While existing research primarily focuses\non evaluating the effectiveness of quantized LLMs compared to their original\ncounterparts, the impact on robustness remains largely unexplored.In this\npaper, we present the first systematic investigation of how quantization\naffects the robustness of LLMs in code generation tasks. Through extensive\nexperiments across four prominent LLM families (LLaMA, DeepSeek, CodeGen, and\nStarCoder) with parameter scales ranging from 350M to 33B, we evaluate\nrobustness from dual perspectives: adversarial attacks on input prompts and\nnoise perturbations on model architecture. Our findings challenge conventional\nwisdom by demonstrating that quantized LLMs often exhibit superior robustness\ncompared to their full-precision counterparts, with 51.59% versus 42.86% of our\nadversarial experiments showing better resilience in quantized LLMs. Similarly,\nour noise perturbation experiments also confirm that LLMs after quantitation\ngenerally withstand higher levels of weight disturbances. These results suggest\nthat quantization not only reduces computational requirements but can actually\nenhance LLMs' reliability in code generation tasks, providing valuable insights\nfor developing more robust and efficient LLM deployment strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u538b\u7f29\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9LLMs\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cdLLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u7684LLMs\u572851.59%\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u627f\u53d7\u66f4\u9ad8\u6743\u91cd\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u4ec5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u589e\u5f3aLLMs\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We study how to design a prefiltering\nsearch algorithm that remains robust under varying selectivities and under\ndifferent correlations between subset S and query vector vQ.

Pretrained using self-supervised\nlearning on data from laparoscopic surgical tasks and endotracheal intubation\n(ETI), the model achieves greater than 88% classification accuracy on all\ntasks, with Matthews Correlation Coefficient exceeding 0.91 on ETI. It\ngeneralizes to a novel emergency airway procedure--cricothyrotomy--using fewer\nthan 30 labeled samples and a lightweight (less than 2k parameter) adapter\nmodule, attaining an AUC greater than 87%. Interpretability is achieved via a\nnovel channel attention mechanism--developed specifically for fNIRS--that\nidentifies functionally coherent prefrontal sub-networks validated through\nablation studies. Temporal attention patterns align with task-critical phases\nand capture stress-induced changes in neural variability, offering insight into\ndynamic cognitive states.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8efNIRS\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684Transformer\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6280\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u3001\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7e41\u7410\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3fNIRS\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u9002\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc788%\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8AUC\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Ensuring robust encryption for sensitive\ninformation is critical for systems' compliance with security standards.\nAlthough holistic database encryption provides strong protection, existing\ndatabase systems often require a complete backup and restore cycle, resulting\nin prolonged downtime and increased storage usage. This makes it difficult to\nimplement online encryption techniques in high-throughput environments without\ndisrupting critical operations.\n  To address this challenge, we envision a solution that enables online\ndatabase encryption aligned with system activity, eliminating the need for\ndowntime, storage overhead, or full-database reprocessing. Central to this\nvision is the ability to predict which parts of the database will be accessed\nnext, allowing encryption to be applied online. As a step towards this\nsolution, this study proposes a predictive approach that leverages deep\nlearning models to forecast database lock sequences, using IBM Db2 as the\ndatabase system under study. In this study, we collected a specialized dataset\nfrom TPC-C benchmark workloads, leveraging lock event logs for model training\nand evaluation. We applied deep learning architectures, such as Transformer and\nLSTM, to evaluate models for various table-level and page-level lock\npredictions. We benchmark the accuracy of the trained models versus a Naive\nBaseline across different prediction horizons and timelines.\n  The study experiments demonstrate that the proposed deep learning-based\nmodels achieve up to 49% average accuracy for table-level and 66% for\npage-level predictions, outperforming a Naive Baseline.

We observe that while current memory\npractices have begun to transcend the limitations of single interactions, they\nremain conceptually grounded in \"bound memory\" in terms of design concept-where\nmemory is treated as local state attached to specific context or entities,\nforming \"memory silos\" that impede cross-entity collaboration. To overcome this\narchitectural bottleneck, this paper proposes the timely design perspective of\n\"Memory as a Service\" (MaaS). MaaS advocates decoupling memory from its\nconventional role as an interaction byproduct and encapsulating it as a modular\nservice that can be independently callable, dynamically composable, and finely\ngoverned. At its core, MaaS leverages the duality of memory-its inherently\nprivate nature and its potential for public service-to grant memory controlled,\non-demand interoperability across entities. This paper introduces a\ntwo-dimensional design space defined by entity structure and service type,\nillustrating how MaaS aligns with current memory practices while naturally\nextending them to cross-entity collaborative scenarios.

However, CQF's use of a single cycle restricts its ability to\nsupport TSN traffic with diverse timing requirements. Multi-Cyclic Queuing and\nForwarding (Multi-CQF) is a new and emerging TSN shaping mechanism that uses\nmultiple cycles on the same egress port, allowing it to accommodate TSN flows\nwith varied timing requirements more effectively than CQF. Despite its\npotential, current Multi-CQF configuration studies are limited, leading to a\nlack of comprehensive research, poor understanding of the mechanism, and\nlimited adoption of Multi-CQF in practical applications. Previous work has\nshown the impact of Time Injection (TI), defined as the start time of\nTime-Triggered (TT) flows at the source node, on CQF queue resource\nutilization. However, the impact of TI has not yet been explored in the context\nof Multi-CQF. This paper introduces a set of constraints and leverages Domain\nSpecific Knowledge (DSK) to reduce the search space for Multi-CQF\nconfiguration. Building on this foundation, we develop an open-source Genetic\nAlgorithm (GA) and a hybrid GA-Simulated Annealing (GASA) approach to\nefficiently configure Multi-CQF networks and introduce TI in Multi-CQF to\nenhance schedulability. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms\nsignificantly increase the number of scheduled TT flows compared to the\nbaseline Simulated Annealing (SA) model, improving scheduling by an average of\n15%.

However, current\nDGF tools are constrained by insufficient runtime feedback, limiting their\nefficiency in reaching targets and exploring state spaces. This study presents\nHF-DGF, a novel directed grey-box fuzzing framework. Its seed scheduling is\nguided by a hybrid feedback mechanism integrating control-flow distance,\nvalue-flow influence score, and slice coverage. To enable precise control-flow\ndistance feedback, we propose a backward-stepping algorithm to calculate basic\nblock-level seed distances on a virtual inter-procedural control-flow graph\n(ICFG). For effective state space exploration, we introduce value-flow\ninfluence and a corresponding metric, the value-flow influence score.\nAdditionally, to mitigate runtime overhead from hybrid feedback, we adopt a\nnovel selective instrumentation strategy.

Among these, Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) approaches have\nshown great promise. Recent advances demonstrate that directly leveraging LLMs\ncan achieve leading results. However, these techniques remain suboptimal in\ngenerating contextually relevant and accurate patches, as they often overlook\nrepair ingredients crucial for practical program repair. In this paper, we\npropose ReinFix, a novel framework that enables LLMs to autonomously search for\nrepair ingredients throughout both the reasoning and solution phases of bug\nfixing. In the reasoning phase, ReinFix integrates static analysis tools to\nretrieve internal ingredients, such as variable definitions, to assist the LLM\nin root cause analysis when it encounters difficulty understanding the context.\nDuring the solution phase, when the LLM lacks experience in fixing specific\nbugs, ReinFix searches for external ingredients from historical bug fixes with\nsimilar bug patterns, leveraging both the buggy code and its root cause to\nguide the LLM in identifying appropriate repair actions, thereby increasing the\nlikelihood of generating correct patches.

These escalating trends underscore the urgent\nneed for effective approaches that can automatically detect and understand\nsoftware vulnerabilities. Objective: However, the scarcity of labeled samples\nand the class imbalance issue in vulnerability datasets present significant\nchallenges for both Vulnerability Type Prediction (VTP) and Line-level\nVulnerability Detection (LVD), especially for rare yet critical vulnerability\ntypes. Moreover, most existing studies treat VTP and LVD as independent tasks,\noverlooking their inherent correlation, which limits the potential to leverage\nshared semantic patterns across tasks. Methods: To address these limitations,\nwe propose a unified approach that integrates Embedding-Layer Driven\nAdversarial Training (EDAT) with Multi-task Learning (MTL). Specifically, EDAT\nenhances model robustness by introducing adversarial perturbations to\nidentifier embeddings, guided by semantic importance. Meanwhile, MTL improves\noverall performance by leveraging shared representations and inter-task\ncorrelations between VTP and LVD. Results: Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both VTP\nand LVD tasks. For VTP, it yields notable improvements in accuracy, precision,\nrecall, and F1-score, particularly in identifying rare vulnerability types.\nSimilarly, for LVD, our approach enhances line-level detection accuracy while\nsignificantly reducing false positives.

NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including\nself-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and\nspontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and\nmorphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This\nlimitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow\nquadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information\nwhich impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands\nof real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this\nlimitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by\nrecent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on\na coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary\nresolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and\ntexture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with\nminimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture\nand loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and\nperformance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD\noutputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent\nproperties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,\ninference remains highly parallelizable and efficient.

As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling\nmatrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability\nto higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the\nimplementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to\nrepresent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the\nintrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO\n(spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional\nstructures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with\nthe convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can\nbe efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing.

Due to the inherent non-convexity\nand NP-hardness of USBJOP, we decompose it into three sub-optimization\nproblems, \\textit{i.e.}, association between UAV-SIMs and users optimization\nproblem (AUUOP), UAV location optimization problem (ULOP), and UAV-SIM phase\nshifts optimization problem (USPSOP), and solve them using an alternating\noptimization strategy.

Following this, we highlight\nseveral opportunities for collaborative UAV swarm secure applications enabled\nby satellite networks, including achieving physical layer security in scenarios\ninvolving data dissemination, data relay, eavesdropper collusion, and imperfect\neavesdropper information.

In this\npaper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge\ncan improve LLM-based program repair.

We evaluate this framework on a\ndataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini),\nand analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting\nknowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314)\nusing Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug\ntypes show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while\nonly a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that\ndifferent bug types require different levels of contextual information for\neffective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that\nmore complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI\nbugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information.

Existing online repair solutions\nenforce ADS compliance by transforming unacceptable trajectories into\nacceptable ones based on predefined specifications, such as rule-based\nconstraints or training datasets. However, these approaches often lack\ngeneralizability, adaptability and tend to be overly conservative, resulting in\nineffective repairs that not only fail to mitigate safety risks sufficiently\nbut also degrade the overall driving experience. To address this issue, we\npropose Adaptive Decision Repair (ADReFT), a novel and effective repair method\nthat identifies safety-critical states through offline learning from failed\ntests and generates appropriate mitigation actions to improve ADS safety.\nSpecifically, ADReFT incorporates a transformer-based model with two joint\nheads, State Monitor and Decision Adapter, designed to capture complex driving\nenvironment interactions to evaluate state safety severity and generate\nadaptive repair actions. Given the absence of oracles for state safety\nidentification, we first pretrain ADReFT using supervised learning with coarse\nannotations, i.e., labeling states preceding violations as positive samples and\nothers as negative samples.

Nodes can employ single-hop communication which, despite its\nease, may necessitate energy-intensive long-range communication to cover long\ndistances. Conversely, multi-hop communication allows for more energy-efficient\nshort-range communication since nodes can rely on other nodes to forward their\ndata. Yet, this approach requires relay nodes to be available and continuous\nmaintenance of a dynamically changing distributed state. At the same time,\nenergy harvesting has the potential to outperform traditional battery-based\nsystems by improving their lifetime, scalability with lower maintenance costs,\nand environmental impact. However, the limited and temporally and spatially\nvariable harvested energy poses significant challenges for networking in energy\nharvesting networks, particularly considering the energy demands and\ncharacteristics of both multi-hop and single-hop communication. We propose\nE-WAN, a protocol for energy harvesting wide-area low-power networks that\nbuilds on the concept of \\emph{virtual sub-networks} to enable\nresource-efficient multi-hop communication when possible and reliable however\nenergy-intensive point-to-point communication otherwise. Nodes autonomously and\ndynamically move between the two and adjust to changing network states and\nresources based only on easily obtainable network state information. We\nillustrate E-WAN's advantages both in terms of efficiency and adaptability in\nvarious communication and harvesting scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nE-WAN operating in a realistic setting by deploying an energy harvesting\nnetwork in a real-world indoor environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aE-WAN\u7684\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u5e7f\u57df\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u8df3\u548c\u5355\u8df3\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u7edc\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982IoT\u3001WSN\u548cCPS\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5355\u8df3\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u5f0f\u5404\u6709\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u7f51\u7edc\u9762\u4e34\u80fd\u91cf\u4f9b\u5e94\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "E-WAN\u534f\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\u591a\u8df3\u548c\u5355\u8df3\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6613\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u81ea\u4e3b\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "E-WAN\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "E-WAN\u534f\u8bae\u4e3a\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

This paper presents a test environment that combines a\nVehiclein-the-Loop (ViL) test bench with a motion laboratory, demonstrating the\nfeasibility of cyber-physical (CP) testing of vehicle-pedestrian and\nvehicle-cyclist interactions. Building upon previous work focused on pedestrian\nlocalization, we further validate a human pose estimation (HPE) approach\nthrough a comparative analysis of real-world (RW) and virtual representations\nof VRUs. The study examines the perception of full-body motion using a\ncommercial monocular camera-based 3Dskeletal detection AI. The virtual scene is\ngenerated in Unreal Engine 5, where VRUs are animated in real time and\nprojected onto a screen to stimulate the camera. The proposed stimulation\ntechnique ensures the correct perspective, enabling realistic vehicle\nperception. To assess the accuracy and consistency of HPE across RW and CP\ndomains, we analyze the reliability of detections as well as variations in\nmovement trajectories and joint estimation stability. The validation includes\ndynamic test scenarios where human avatars, both walking and cycling, are\nmonitored under controlled conditions. Our results show a strong alignment in\nHPE between RW and CP test conditions for stable motion patterns, while notable\ninaccuracies persist under dynamic movements and occlusions, particularly for\ncomplex cyclist postures.

Developing multi-fingered, synchronized control of a\ncolonoscope requires significant time and exposure to the device. Current\ntraining methods inhibit this development by relying on tool hand-off for\nexpert demonstrations. There is a need for colonoscopy training tools that\nenable in-hand expert guidance in real-time. We present a new concept of a\ntandem training system that uses a telemanipulated preceptor colonoscope to\nguide novice users as they perform a colonoscopy. This system is capable of\ndual-control and can automatically toggle between expert and novice control of\na standard colonoscope's angulation control wheels. Preliminary results from a\nuser study with novice and expert users show the effectiveness of this device\nas a skill acquisition tool. We believe that this device has the potential to\naccelerate skill acquisition for colonoscopy and, in the future, enable\nindividualized instruction and responsive teaching through bidirectional\nactuation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
