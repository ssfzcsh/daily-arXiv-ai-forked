In\nthis study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that\naddresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the\nsynthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators.

Despite accounting for just approximately\n5% of total instructions, memory allocation can result in up to a 2.7x\nperformance variation depending on the allocator used. This effect arises from\nthe complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core\nsystems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading\nto cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead.\nOffloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a\npotential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache\npollution. However, these accelerators currently have limited support for\nmulti-threaded applications, and synchronization between cores and accelerators\nremains a significant challenge.\n  We present SpeedMalloc, using a lightweight support-core to process memory\nallocation tasks in multi-threaded applications. The support-core is a\nlightweight programmable processor with efficient cross-core data\nsynchronization and houses all allocator metadata in its own caches. This\ndesign minimizes cache conflicts with user data and eliminates the need for\ncross-core metadata synchronization.

This effect arises from\nthe complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core\nsystems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading\nto cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead.\nOffloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a\npotential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache\npollution.

To address these problems, we propose a novel method for\neffective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a\ndedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation.\nWe then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network\n(GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that\nconcisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further\nfacilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method,\nwhich explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them\nto specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an\nimprovement of 10\\% in accuracy and precision and 26\\% in recall compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings."}

In this paper, we analyze the isolation\nstrategies employed by existing TEE containers to protect secure applications.\nTo address the challenges in analyzing these interfaces, we designed an\nautomated analyzer to precisely identify and evaluate their isolation\nboundaries. We observed that some TEE containers fail to achieve their intended\ngoals due to critical design and implementation flaws, such as information\nleakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks, which pose\nsignificant security risks. Drawing from our findings, we share key lessons to\nguide the development of more secure container solutions and discuss emerging\ntrends in TEE containerization design."}

However, the application of health agents to fulfill the\ndiverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.\nIn this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is\nable to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices\nand common personal health records, and provide personalized health\nrecommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an\nassistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum\nqueries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered\nthrough a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified\nthree major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by\na specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal\ntime-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent\nthat integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,\npersonalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data\ninsights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking\nusers' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent\n(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions\nto address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the\nmulti-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10\nbenchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of\neffort from health experts and end-users.

The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality\nof embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language\nand actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video\ngeneration--hindering generative models from achieving a \"GPT moment\" in the\nembodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data\nfar exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on\nthis insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive\nEmbodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short\nhorizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic\nconcepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning\ncomplexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4)\ndecreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model\n(VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further\nenables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization\nof primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework\nleverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic\nawareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction\nand high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and\ngeneral-purpose embodied intelligence."}

This paper explores the current\nlandscape of publicly accessible large language models (LLMs) in a mathematical\nresearch context, based on developments up to August 2, 2025. Our analysis of\nrecent benchmarks, such as MathArena and the Open Proof Corpus (Balunovi\\'c et\nal., 2025; Dekoninck et al., 2025), reveals a complex duality: while\nstate-of-the-art models demonstrate strong abilities in solving problems and\nevaluating proofs, they also exhibit systematic flaws, including a lack of\nself-critique and a model depending discrepancy between final-answer accuracy\nand full-proof validity.\n  Based on these findings, we propose a durable framework for integrating AI\ninto the research workflow, centered on the principle of the augmented\nmathematician. In this model, the AI functions as a copilot under the critical\nguidance of the human researcher, an approach distilled into five guiding\nprinciples for effective and responsible use. We then systematically explore\nseven fundamental ways AI can be applied across the research lifecycle, from\ncreativity and ideation to the final writing process, demonstrating how these\nprinciples translate into concrete practice.\n  We conclude that the primary role of AI is currently augmentation rather than\nautomation. This requires a new skill set focused on strategic prompting,\ncritical verification, and methodological rigor in order to effectively use\nthese powerful tools."}

Even\nwhen adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations\nmust exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we\npresent MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)\nenables physicians to manually select and use different models without\nprogramming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical\nVLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face\nopen-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through\nDocker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment.

These\nblack-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on\nshallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly\ndecouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language\ncausal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human\ncognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level\nvideo content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and\nlogically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal\nChain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,\nand a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in\nthese chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a\nscalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing\ndatasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation\nmetric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art\nmodels, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and\ngeneralization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine\nacross diverse domains.
