Integrating bug-fix patches across such divergent variants poses\nchallenges due to structural drift, including refactorings that rename,\nrelocate, or reorganize code elements and obscure semantic correspondence. This\npaper presents an empirical study of patch integration failures in 14 divergent\npair of variants and introduces RePatch, a refactoring-aware integration system\nfor Java repositories. RePatch extends the RefMerge framework, originally\ndesigned for symmetric merges, by supporting asymmetric patch transfer. RePatch\ninverts refactorings in both the source and target to realign the patch\ncontext, applies the patch, and replays the transformations to preserve the\nintent of the variant. In our evaluation of 478 bug-fix pull requests, Git\ncherry-pick fails in 64.4% of cases due to structural misalignments, while\nRePatch successfully integrates 52.8% of the previously failing patches.

Early approaches in code\ntranslation rely on static rule-based methods, but they suffer from limited\ncoverage due to dependence on predefined rule patterns. Recent works regard the\ntask as a sequence-to-sequence problem by leveraging large language models\n(LLMs). Although these LLM-based methods are capable of reducing unsafe code\nblocks, the translated code often exhibits issues in following Rust rules and\nmaintaining semantic consistency. On one hand, existing methods adopt a direct\nprompting strategy to translate the C code, which struggles to accommodate the\nsyntactic rules between C and Rust. On the other hand, this strategy makes it\ndifficult for LLMs to accurately capture the semantics of complex code. To\naddress these challenges, we propose IRENE, an LLM-based framework that\nIntegrates RulEs aNd sEmantics to enhance translation. IRENE consists of three\nmodules: 1) a rule-augmented retrieval module that selects relevant translation\nexamples based on rules generated from a static analyzer developed by us,\nthereby improving the handling of Rust rules; 2) a structured summarization\nmodule that produces a structured summary for guiding LLMs to enhance the\nsemantic understanding of C code; 3) an error-driven translation module that\nleverages compiler diagnostics to iteratively refine translations.

This paper introduces a multi-agent\nsystem (MAS) designed to extract and analyze narrative arcs by implementing\nprinciples of computational memory architectures. The system conceptualizes\nnarrative understanding through analogues of human memory: Large Language\nModels (LLMs) provide a form of semantic memory for general narrative patterns,\nwhile a vector database stores specific arc progressions as episodic memories.\nA multi-agent workflow simulates working memory processes to integrate these\ninformation types. Tested on the first season of Grey's Anatomy (ABC 2005-),\nthe MAS identifies three arc types: Anthology (self-contained), Soap\n(relationship-focused), and Genre-Specific. These arcs and their episodic\ndevelopments are stored in a vector database, facilitating structured analysis\nand semantic comparison. To bridge automation with critical interpretation, a\ngraphical interface enables human oversight and refinement of the system's\nnarrative memory. While demonstrating strong performance in identifying\nAnthology Arcs and character entities, the system's reliance on textual\nparatexts (episode summaries) revealed limitations in discerning overlapping\narcs and opaque dynamics, underscoring the challenges in computational memory\nconsolidation versus human holistic understanding.

Each handler\nhas a mailbox (modelled as a queue) for receiving messages, with the constraint\nthat the handler processes its messages sequentially. Executions of messages by\ndifferent handlers may be interleaved. A central problem in this setting is\nchecking whether a candidate execution is consistent with the semantics of\nevent-driven programs. In this paper, we propose an axiomatic semantics for\neventdriven programs based on the standard notion of traces (also known as\nexecution graphs). We prove the equivalence of axiomatic and operational\nsemantics. This allows us to rephrase the consistency problem axiomatically,\nresulting in the event-driven consistency problem: checking whether a given\ntrace is consistent. We analyze the computational complexity of this problem\nand show that it is NP-complete, even when the number of handler threads is\nbounded.

Our results suggest that IPv6 offers\nnew areas for censorship circumvention researchers to explore, providing\npotentially new ways to evade censors. As more users gain access to IPv6\naddresses and networks, there will be a need for tools that take advantage of\nIPv6 techniques and infrastructure to bypass censorship."}

In\nrecent years, these models have gained prominence in machine learning due to\nthe development of approaches such as generative adversarial networks (GANs),\nvariational autoencoders (VAEs), and transformer-based architectures such as\nGPT. These models have applications across various domains, such as image\ngeneration, text synthesis, and music composition. In recommender systems,\ngenerative models, referred to as Gen-RecSys, improve the accuracy and\ndiversity of recommendations by generating structured outputs, text-based\ninteractions, and multimedia content. By leveraging these capabilities,\nGen-RecSys can produce more personalized, engaging, and dynamic user\nexperiences, expanding the role of AI in eCommerce, media, and beyond.\n  Our book goes beyond existing literature by offering a comprehensive\nunderstanding of generative models and their applications, with a special focus\non deep generative models (DGMs) and their classification. We introduce a\ntaxonomy that categorizes DGMs into three types: ID-driven models, large\nlanguage models (LLMs), and multimodal models. Each category addresses unique\ntechnical and architectural advancements within its respective research area.\nThis taxonomy allows researchers to easily navigate developments in Gen-RecSys\nacross domains such as conversational AI and multimodal content generation.\nAdditionally, we examine the impact and potential risks of generative models,\nemphasizing the importance of robust evaluation frameworks."}

To address this issue, we propose a novel multimodal\nretrieval-augmented framework to simultaneously incorporate inter-sample\nmodality-level reference context and cross-sample sample-level reference\ncontext to enhance the multimodal features. In particular, we first design a\ncontrastive cross-modal retrieval module to retrieve semantic similar samples\nand enhance target modality. To endow the model to capture both inter-sample\nand intra-sample information, we integrate two different types of prompts,\nmodality-level prompts and sample-level prompts, to generate modality-level and\nsample-level reference contexts, respectively.

The goal is to align\ntechnical interoperability with legal concepts of interoperability, thereby\nenhancing the practical implementation of systematic interoperability in the\nnext generation of the Web. This study finds that, firstly, Web 3.0's concept\nof interoperability spans data, systems, and applications, while the Data Act\nfocuses solely on data.

This subtle power can drastically\nundermine classical exploration strategies designed for an always active black\nhole. We study this perpetual exploration problem in the presence of at most\none BBH, without initial knowledge of the network size. Since the underlying\ngraph may be 1-connected, perpetual exploration of the entire graph may be\ninfeasible. We thus define two variants: \\pbmPerpExpl\\ and \\pbmPerpExplHome. In\nthe former, the agents are tasked to perform perpetual exploration of at least\none component, obtained after the exclusion of the BBH. In the latter, the\nagents are tasked to perform perpetual exploration of the component which\ncontains the \\emph{home} node, where agents are initially co-located.\nNaturally, \\pbmPerpExplHome\\ is a special case of \\pbmPerpExpl.

Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the\nsemantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several\ntime slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission\nto acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being\neavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming\nsignals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic\ninformation. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for\nsemantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not\ncommunicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit\npower of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic\ninformation transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power\nto maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of\nthe user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted\ntwin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine\nthe transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot\nwithout the communications between the server and the jammer.

The visual\ninterface supports browsing, query composition, and partial search without\nrequiring formal syntax. By combining fuzzy semantics with embedding-based\nreasoning, FuzzyVis enables flexible interpretation, efficient computation, and\nexploratory learning. Case studies demonstrate how FuzzyVis supports subtle\ninformation needs and helps users uncover relevant concepts in large, complex\nontologies."}

We find that LLM facilitation\nincreases information shared within a discussion by raising the minimum level\nof engagement with the task among group members, and that these gains come at\nlimited cost in terms of participants' attitudes towards the task, their group,\nor their facilitator.

We synthesize interdisciplinary literature across\nlived experience philosophy, human-centered design, and human-AI interaction,\narguing that centering lived experience can lead to models that more accurately\nreflect the retrospective, emotional, and contextual dimensions of human\ncognition. Drawing from a wide body of work across psychology, education,\nhealthcare, and social policy, we present a targeted taxonomy of lived\nexperiences with specific applicability to AI systems. To ground our framework,\nwe examine three application domains (i) education, (ii) healthcare, and (iii)\ncultural alignment, illustrating how lived experience informs user goals,\nsystem expectations, and ethical considerations in each context. We further\nincorporate insights from AI system operators and human-AI partnerships to\nhighlight challenges in responsibility allocation, mental model calibration,\nand long-term system adaptation.

This paper introduces a multi-agent\nsystem (MAS) designed to extract and analyze narrative arcs by implementing\nprinciples of computational memory architectures. The system conceptualizes\nnarrative understanding through analogues of human memory: Large Language\nModels (LLMs) provide a form of semantic memory for general narrative patterns,\nwhile a vector database stores specific arc progressions as episodic memories.\nA multi-agent workflow simulates working memory processes to integrate these\ninformation types. Tested on the first season of Grey's Anatomy (ABC 2005-),\nthe MAS identifies three arc types: Anthology (self-contained), Soap\n(relationship-focused), and Genre-Specific. These arcs and their episodic\ndevelopments are stored in a vector database, facilitating structured analysis\nand semantic comparison. To bridge automation with critical interpretation, a\ngraphical interface enables human oversight and refinement of the system's\nnarrative memory. While demonstrating strong performance in identifying\nAnthology Arcs and character entities, the system's reliance on textual\nparatexts (episode summaries) revealed limitations in discerning overlapping\narcs and opaque dynamics, underscoring the challenges in computational memory\nconsolidation versus human holistic understanding. This memory-centric approach\nhighlights the potential of combining AI-driven memory processing with human\nexpertise. Beyond television, it offers promise for serialized written formats\nwhere narrative is entirely text-based.
