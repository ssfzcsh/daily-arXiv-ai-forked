However, manually writing annotations can be time-consuming and\ntedious. The result is that most real-world Python code remains largely\nuntyped. Past approaches to annotating types in Python code fall short in a\nnumber of ways. Static approaches struggle with dynamic features and infer\noverly broad types. AI-based methods are inherently unsound and can miss rare\nor user-defined types. Dynamic methods can impose extreme runtime overheads,\ndegrading performance by up to 270x, abort execution as they exhaust resources,\nand even infer incorrect types that lead to runtime errors.

However, when harm occurs, laws, policies, and\nregulations also shape AI accountability by impacting how harmed individuals\ncan obtain recourse. Current approaches to XAI explore physicians' medical and\nrelational needs to counter harms to patients, but there is a need to\nunderstand how XAI systems should account for the legal considerations of those\nimpacted. We conduct an analysis of 31 legal cases and reported harms to\nidentify patterns around how AI systems impact patient care. Our findings\nreflect how patients' medical care relies on a complex web of\nstakeholders--physicians, state health departments, health insurers, care\nfacilities, among others--and many AI systems deployed across their healthcare\ndelivery negatively impact their care.

We shift the frame from\nphysician-centered to patient-centered accountability approaches by describing\nhow lawyers and technologists need to recognize and address where AI harms\nhappen.

To support this shift, scalable\nprotocols for tool integration are essential. The Model Context Protocol (MCP),\nintroduced by Anthropic in 2024, offers a schema-driven standard for dynamic\ntool discovery and invocation. Yet, building MCP servers remains manual and\nrepetitive, requiring developers to write glue code, handle authentication, and\nconfigure schemas by hand-replicating much of the integration effort MCP aims\nto eliminate.\n  This paper investigates whether MCP server construction can be meaningfully\nautomated. We begin by analyzing adoption trends: among 22,000+ MCP-tagged\nGitHub repositories created within six months of release, fewer than 5% include\nservers, typically small, single-maintainer projects dominated by repetitive\nscaffolding. To address this gap, we present AutoMCP, a compiler that generates\nMCP servers from OpenAPI 2.0/3.0 specifications. AutoMCP parses REST API\ndefinitions and produces complete server implementations, including schema\nregistration and authentication handling.\n  We evaluate AutoMCP on 50 real-world APIs spanning 5,066 endpoints across\nover 10 domains.

This paper proposes a large-scale validation method\nusing a network slicing prediction model to forecast latency using Deep Neural\nNetworks (DNNs) and basic ML algorithms embedded within an NS architecture,\nevaluated in real large-scale production testbeds. It measures and compares the\nperformance of different DNNs and ML algorithms, considering a distributed\ndatabase application deployed as a network slice over two large-scale\nproduction testbeds. The investigation highlights how AI-based prediction\nmodels can enhance network slicing orchestration architectures and presents a\nseamless, production-ready validation method as an alternative to fully\ncontrolled simulations or laboratory setups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDNN\u548c\u57fa\u672cML\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u4ea7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1AI\u539f\u751f\u7f16\u6392\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u9700\u8981AI\u539f\u751f\u7f16\u6392\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176ML\u7f16\u6392\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528DNN\u548c\u57fa\u7840ML\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u751f\u4ea7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53f0\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eAI\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u7f16\u6392\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u7f16\u6392\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To this end, we introduce EBench-18K, the first large-scale image\nEditing Benchmark including 18K edited images with fine-grained human\npreference annotations for evaluating TIE. Specifically, EBench-18K includes\n1,080 source images with corresponding editing prompts across 21 tasks, 18K+\nedited images produced by 17 state-of-the-art TIE models, 55K+ mean opinion\nscores (MOSs) assessed from three evaluation dimensions, and 18K+\nquestion-answering (QA) pairs.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are\nincreasingly used to provide educational feedback; however, negative\nperceptions may limit their practical use, and little is known about how\npre-service teachers' perceptions and behavioral responses differ by feedback\nsource. This study investigates how the perceived source of feedback - LLM,\nexpert, or peer - influences feedback perception and uptake, and whether\nrecognition accuracy and feedback quality moderate these effects. In a\nrandomized experiment with 273 pre-service teachers, participants received\nwritten feedback on a mathematics learning goal, identified its source, rated\nfeedback perceptions across five dimensions (fairness, usefulness, acceptance,\nwillingness to improve, positive and negative affect), and revised the learning\ngoal according to the feedback (i.e. feedback uptake). Results revealed that\nLLM-generated feedback received the highest ratings in fairness and usefulness,\nleading to the highest uptake (52%).

This\npaper examines how annotators evaluate the safety of AI-generated images,\nfocusing on the qualitative reasoning behind their judgments. Analyzing 5,372\nopen-ended comments, we find that annotators consistently invoke moral,\nemotional, and contextual reasoning that extends beyond structured safety\ncategories. Many reflect on potential harm to others more than to themselves,\ngrounding their judgments in lived experience, collective risk, and\nsociocultural awareness. Beyond individual perceptions, we also find that the\nstructure of the task itself -- including annotation guidelines -- shapes how\nannotators interpret and express harm.

Due to the significant heterogeneity of these signals, which we\nsummarize as the M5 problem, previous works only focus on small sub-problems\nand employ specialized models, failing to utilize the synergies between\nmodalities and the powerful scaling law. However, we argue that the M5 signals\ncan be modeled in a unified manner due to the intrinsic similarity. As a\nresult, we propose FISHER, a Foundation model for multi-modal Industrial Signal\ncompreHEnsive Representation. To support arbitrary sampling rates, FISHER\nconsiders the increment of sampling rate as the concatenation of sub-band\ninformation. Specifically, FISHER takes the STFT sub-band as the modeling unit\nand adopts a teacher student SSL framework for pre-training. We also develop\nthe RMIS benchmark, which evaluates the representations of M5 industrial\nsignals on multiple health management tasks. Compared with top SSL models,\nFISHER showcases versatile and outstanding capabilities with a general\nperformance gain up to 5.03%, along with much more efficient scaling curves.

However, conventional\nRISs are fundamentally limited by the double path loss effect, which severely\nattenuates the reflected signals. To overcome this, active RIS architectures,\ncapable of amplifying impinging signals, have been proposed. This chapter\ninvestigates the modeling, performance analysis, and optimization of active\nRISs, focusing on two hardware designs: a dual-RIS structure with a single\nPower Amplifier (PA), and a reflection amplification structure at the unit cell\nlevel using tunnel diodes. For the PA-based design, a comprehensive\nmathematical model is developed, and closed-form expressions for the received\nsignal-to-noise ratio, bit error probability, and Energy Efficiency (EE) are\nderived. An optimization framework for configuring the phase shifts and\namplifier gain is proposed to maximize system capacity under power constraints.\nRegarding the second design, the integration of a tunnel diode into the unit\ncell is carefully studied by analyzing its I-V characteristic, enabling the\nderivation of the negative resistance range and the power consumption model.\nFurthermore, the intrinsic phase-amplitude coupling of the reflection\ncoefficient is characterized through compact linear algebra formulations,\nenabling practical optimization of active RISs. Extensive numerical simulations\nvalidate the theoretical analyses, demonstrating that active RISs can\neffectively overcome the double path loss limitation and achieve favorable EE\ntrade-offs compared to passive RISs.

While nominally valid\nin the large-system limit, it is shown that the derived Gaussian approximation\nfor the mutual information can be quite accurate, even for modest-sized antenna\narrays and metasurfaces. The above results are particularly useful when\nfast-fading conditions are present, which renders channel estimation\nchallenging. The derived analysis indicates that, when the channel close to an\nRIS is correlated, for instance due to small angle spread which is reasonable\nfor wireless systems with increasing carrier frequencies, the communication\nlink benefits significantly from statistical RIS optimization, resulting in\ngains that are surprisingly higher than the nearly uncorrelated case. More\nimportantly, the presented novel asymptotic properties of the correlation\nmatrices of the impinging and outgoing signals at the RISs can be deployed to\noptimize the metasurfaces without brute-force numerical optimization.

IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering", "summary": "Large Language Models have been recently exploited as judges for complex\nnatural language processing tasks, such as Q&A. The basic idea is to delegate\nto an LLM the assessment of the \"quality\" of the output provided by an\nautomated technique for tasks for which: (i) quantitative metrics would only\ntell part of the story, and; (ii) a large-scale human-based evaluation would be\ntoo expensive. LLMs-as-a-judge, if proven effective for a specific task, can\nalso unlock new possibilities for automation, with several LLMs proposing a\nsolution for a given instance of the task and others judging and deciding what\nis the best output to show the user. We study the effectiveness of\nLLMs-as-a-judge for two code-related tasks, namely code generation and code\nsummarization. The rationale for choosing these tasks is two-fold. First,\nquantitative metrics are usually not enough for the assessment of code\nsummarizers/generators. For example, it is well documented that metrics such as\nBLEU are quite weak proxies for the quality of the generated summaries. Second,\neven state-of-the-art techniques still struggle with handling complex instances\nof these tasks, making them good candidates for benefiting from more advanced\nsolutions envisioning collaboration among LLMs. For code generation, we check\nwhether eight LLMs are able to judge the correctness of 1,405 Java methods and\n1,281 Python functions generated by the same LLMs or implemented by humans.

The code fragments\nthat preserve the logic of known vulnerabilities are known as vulnerable code\nclones (VCCs).

In this paper, we propose VulCoCo, a lightweight and\nscalable approach that combines embedding-based retrieval with large language\nmodel (LLM) validation. Starting from a set of known vulnerable functions, we\nretrieve syntactically or semantically similar candidate functions from a large\ncorpus and use an LLM to assess whether the candidates retain the\nvulnerability.

In this paper, we propose\nColaUntangle, a new collaborative consultation framework for commit untangling\nthat models both explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes.\nColaUntangle integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents in a\nmulti-agent architecture: one agent specializes in explicit dependencies,\nanother in implicit ones, and a reviewer agent synthesizes their perspectives\nthrough iterative consultation. To capture explicit and implicit contextual\ninformation, we construct multi-version Program Dependency Graphs (delta-PDG),\nenabling agents to reason over code relationships with both symbolic and\nsemantic depth. We evaluate ColaUntangle on two widely-used datasets (1,612 C#\nand 14k Java tangled commits). Experimental results show that ColaUntangle\noutperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an improvement of 44% on\nthe C# dataset and 100% on the Java dataset. These findings highlight the\npotential of LLM-based collaborative frameworks for advancing automated commit\nuntangling tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u63d0\u4ea4\u89e3\u7f20\u6846\u67b6ColaUntangle\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63d0\u4ea4\u89e3\u7f20\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u4ea4\u89e3\u7f20\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6d45\u5c42\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u663e\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u63a7\u5236/\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff09\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faColaUntangle\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u663e\u5f0f\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u7248\u672c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\uff08delta-PDG\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cColaUntangle\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cC#\u548cJava\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523044%\u548c100%\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u63d0\u4ea4\u89e3\u7f20\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0cColaUntangle\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In this\npaper, we present Auto-Train for Code Translation (ACT), an innovative\nframework that aims to improve code translation capabilities by enabling\nin-house finetuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs).

Central to ACT is its synthetic data generation\nmodule, which builds extensive, high-quality datasets from initial code\nsamples, incorporating unit tests to ensure functional accuracy and diversity.\nACT's evaluation framework incorporates execution-level checks, offering a\ncomprehensive assessment of translation quality. A key feature in ACT is its\ncontroller module, which manages the entire pipeline by dynamically adjusting\nhyperparameters, orchestrating iterative data generation, and finetuning based\non real-time evaluations. This enables ACT to intelligently optimize when to\ncontinue training, generate additional targeted training data, or stop the\nprocess.

Although originally\ninspired only by Minsky and Clark, the system's structure retrospectively\naligns with computational motifs found in all four theories, including\npredictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control.\n  To assess this convergence, we conducted comparative experiments with\nbaseline LLM agents on multi-step reasoning tasks. The structured agent\nachieved 95.8% task success and exhibited strong constraint adherence, while\nthe baseline system succeeded 62.3% of the time.

While existing ethical frameworks emphasize Consent, Credit,\nand Compensation (C3), they do not adequately address the emergent risks\ninvolving vocal identities that are increasingly decoupled from context,\nauthorship, and control. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 20 professional\nvoice actors, this paper reveals how the synthetic replication of voice without\nenforceable constraints exposes individuals to a range of threats. Beyond\nreputational harm, such as re-purposing voice data in erotic content, offensive\npolitical messaging, and meme culture, we document concerns about\naccountability breakdowns when their voice is leveraged to clone voices that\nare deployed in high-stakes scenarios such as financial fraud, misinformation\ncampaigns, or impersonation scams. In such cases, actors face social and legal\nfallout without recourse, while very few of them have a legal representative or\nunion protection. To make sense of these shifting dynamics, we introduce the\nPRAC3 framework, an expansion of C3 that foregrounds Privacy, Reputation,\nAccountability, Consent, Credit, and Compensation as interdependent pillars of\ndata used in the synthetic voice economy. This framework captures how privacy\nrisks are amplified through non-consensual training, how reputational harm\narises from decontextualized deployment, and how accountability can be\nreimagined AI Data ecosystems.

Yet, many applications\nremain largely inaccessible due to incomplete or missing metadata provided by\ndevelopers - our investigation shows that only 33% of applications on macOS\noffer full accessibility support. While recent work on structured screen\nrepresentation has primarily addressed specific challenges, such as UI element\ndetection or captioning, none has attempted to capture the full complexity of\ndesktop interfaces by replicating their entire hierarchical structure. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce Screen2AX, the first framework to automatically\ncreate real-time, tree-structured accessibility metadata from a single\nscreenshot. Our method uses vision-language and object detection models to\ndetect, describe, and organize UI elements hierarchically, mirroring macOS's\nsystem-level accessibility structure. To tackle the limited availability of\ndata for macOS desktop applications, we compiled and publicly released three\ndatasets encompassing 112 macOS applications, each annotated for UI element\ndetection, grouping, and hierarchical accessibility metadata alongside\ncorresponding screenshots. Screen2AX accurately infers hierarchy trees,\nachieving a 77% F1 score in reconstructing a complete accessibility tree.\nCrucially, these hierarchy trees improve the ability of autonomous agents to\ninterpret and interact with complex desktop interfaces. We introduce\nScreen2AX-Task, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating autonomous\nagent task execution in macOS desktop environments. Using this benchmark, we\ndemonstrate that Screen2AX delivers a 2.2x performance improvement over native\naccessibility representations and surpasses the state-of-the-art OmniParser V2\nsystem on the ScreenSpot benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "Screen2AX\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u622a\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u65f6\u6811\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u684c\u9762\u5e94\u7528\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u652f\u6301\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u754c\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u684c\u9762\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u4ec533%\u7684macOS\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u6574\u652f\u6301\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u83b7\u754c\u9762\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5168\u9762\u7684\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u5143\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "Screen2AX\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u622a\u56fe\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u63cf\u8ff0\u5e76\u5206\u5c42\u7ec4\u7ec7UI\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u590d\u73b0macOS\u7684\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u8fd8\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "Screen2AX\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u6811\u65f6\u7684F1\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a77%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u6027\u80fd\uff082.2\u500d\u4e8e\u539f\u751f\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eOmniParser V2\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "Screen2AX\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u684c\u9762\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u5143\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5176\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u754c\u9762\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u652f\u6301\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}
