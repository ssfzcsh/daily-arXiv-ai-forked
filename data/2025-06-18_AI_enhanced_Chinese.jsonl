This paper presents an open-source, agent-based framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with HL7 FHIR data via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for dynamic extraction and reasoning over electronic health records (EHRs). Built on the established MCP-FHIR implementation, the framework enables declarative access to diverse FHIR resources through JSON-based configurations, supporting real-time summarization, interpretation, and personalized communication across multiple user personas, including clinicians, caregivers, and patients. To ensure privacy and reproducibility, the framework is evaluated using synthetic EHR data from the SMART Health IT sandbox (https://r4.smarthealthit.org/), which conforms to the FHIR R4 standard. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on hardcoded retrieval and static workflows, the proposed method delivers scalable, explainable, and interoperable AI-powered EHR applications.

Here, we extend the IS approach by introducing instruction and solution probabilities as additional heuristics. Instruction probability reflects the expectation of an instruction occurring in a solution, based on the frequency of instruction occurrence in a large code sample. The solution probability for a partial or complete program is simply the product of all constituent instruction probabilities, including duplicates. We treat the minimum solution probabilities observed in code sample program units of different sizes as solution probability thresholds. These thresholds are used to prune the search space as partial solutions are constructed, thereby eliminating any branches containing unlikely combinations of instructions. The new approach has been evaluated using a large sample of human code. We tested two formulations of instruction probability: one based on instruction occurrence across the entire code sample and another that measured the distribution separately for each IS. Our results show that both variants produce substantial further reductions in the IP search space size of up to tens of orders of magnitude, depending on solution size. In combination with IS, reductions of over 100 orders of magnitude can be achieved. We also carried out cross-validation testing to show that the heuristics should work effectively with unseen code.

The temporal coherence inherent in these tasks presents an opportunity to reuse intermediate results from previous frames and avoid redundant computations. Recent work has shown that caching intermediate features to be reused in subsequent inferences is an effective method to reduce latency in diffusion models. We extend this idea to real-time rendering and present ReFrame, which explores different caching policies to optimize trade-offs between quality and performance in rendering workloads. ReFrame can be applied to a variety of encoder-decoder style networks commonly found in rendering pipelines. Experimental results show that we achieve 1.4x speedup on average with negligible quality loss in three real-time rendering tasks.

Modern backscatter systems are no longer simple reflectors of continuous waves but are increasingly designed to interact with complex, data-carrying ambient signals from ubiquitous sources like WiFi, ZigBee, and cellular networks. This review systematically charts the journey of ambient backscatter, particularly focusing on its interaction with ZigBee and other commodity wireless protocols over the last decade. We analyze the progression from foundational proof-of-concept systems that established productive backscatter to modern high-throughput, concurrent, and cross-technology communication architectures. Key advancements in fine-grained modulation, robust synchronization, cross-technology physical layer emulation, and multi-tag coordination are detailed. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art systems highlights the core trade-offs between performance metrics like data rate and range, power consumption, and compatibility with commodity hardware.

Prior approaches either focus on overly simplified hardware descriptions or depend on extensive human guidance to process complex specifications, limiting their scalability and automation potential. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing an LLM agent system, termed Spec2RTL-Agent, designed to directly process complex specification documentation and generate corresponding RTL code implementations, advancing LLM-based RTL code generation toward more realistic application settings. To achieve this goal, Spec2RTL-Agent introduces a novel multi-agent collaboration framework that integrates three key enablers: (1) a reasoning and understanding module that translates specifications into structured, step-by-step implementation plans; (2) a progressive coding and prompt optimization module that iteratively refines the code across multiple representations to enhance correctness and synthesisability for RTL conversion; and (3) an adaptive reflection module that identifies and traces the source of errors during generation, ensuring a more robust code generation flow. Instead of directly generating RTL from natural language, our system strategically generates synthesizable C++ code, which is then optimized for HLS.

In the literature, various nanodevices have been shown to emulate the spin dynamics for such Ising machines with remarkable effectiveness. Other nanodevices have been shown to implement spin-spin coupling with compact footprint and minimal energy dissipation. However, an ideal Ising machine would associate both types of nanodevices, and they must operate synergistically to support annealing: a progressive reduction of machine stochasticity that allows it to settle to energy minimum. Here, we report an Ising machine that combines two nanotechnologies: memristor crossbar -- storing multi-level couplings -- and stochastic magnetic tunnel junction (SMTJ), acting as thermally driven spins. Because the same read voltage that interrogates the crossbar also biases the SMTJs, increasing this voltage automatically lowers the effective temperature of the machine, providing an intrinsic, nearly circuit-free annealing technique. Operating at zero magnetic field, our prototype consistently reaches the global optimum of a 24-vertex weighted MAX-CUT and a 10-vertex, three-color graph-coloring problem.

These signals support personalized and responsive experiences and may also contain unique patterns that can be linked back to individuals. However, privacy mechanisms that naively pair unimodal mechanisms (e.g., independently apply privacy mechanisms for eye and body privatization) are often ineffective at preventing re-identification in practice. In this work, we systematically evaluate real-time privacy mechanisms for XR, both individually and in pair, across eye and body modalities. To preserve usability, all mechanisms were tuned based on empirically grounded thresholds for real-time interaction. We evaluated four eye and ten body mechanisms across multiple datasets, comprising up to 407 participants. Our results show that while obfuscating eye telemetry alone offers moderate privacy gains, body telemetry perturbation is substantially more effective. When carefully paired, multimodal mechanisms reduce re-identification rate from 80.3% to 26.3% in casual XR applications (e.g., VRChat and Job Simulator) and from 84.8% to 26.1% in competitive XR applications (e.g., Beat Saber and Synth Riders), all without violating real-time usability requirements.

We present a sparse version of Bullshark -- one of the most prominent DAG-based consensus protocols -- and demonstrate its improved scalability.\n  Remarkably, unlike other protocols that use random sampling to reduce communication complexity, we manage to avoid sacrificing resilience: the protocol can tolerate up to $f<n/3$ Byzantine faults (where $n$ is the number of participants), same as its less scalable deterministic counterpart.

However, progress is hindered by two key challenges: the rigidity of conventional evaluation metrics such as execution accuracy, which offer coarse, binary feedback, and the scarcity of domain-specific evaluation datasets. This paper addresses these gaps. To enable more nuanced assessment, we introduce a novel F1-score-based 'soft' metric that quantifies the informational overlap between generated and ground-truth SQL results. To address data scarcity, we propose an LLM-driven pipeline that synthesizes realistic question-SQL pairs from database schemas. We demonstrate our contributions through an empirical evaluation on an authentic MRO database.

However, there still lacks a comprehensive metric for assessing the editing quality. Existing metrics either require high human evaluation costs, which hinder large-scale evaluation, or are adapted from other tasks and lose task-specific concerns, failing to comprehensively evaluate both instruction-based modification and preservation of irrelevant regions, resulting in biased evaluation. To tackle this, we introduce a new metric called Balancing Preservation and Modification (BPM), tailored for instruction-based image editing by explicitly disentangling the image into editing-relevant and irrelevant regions for specific consideration. We first identify and locate editing-relevant regions, followed by a two-tier process to assess editing quality: Region-Aware Judge evaluates whether the position and size of the edited region align with the instruction, and Semantic-Aware Judge further assesses the instruction content compliance within editing-relevant regions as well as content preservation within irrelevant regions, yielding comprehensive and interpretable quality assessment. Moreover, the editing-relevant region localization in BPM can be integrated into image editing approaches to improve editing quality, demonstrating its broad applicability. We verify the effectiveness of the BPM metric on comprehensive instruction-editing data, and the results show the highest alignment with human evaluation compared to existing metrics, indicating its efficacy.

This contribution introduces the Fretting-Transformer, an encoderdecoder model that utilizes a T5 transformer architecture to automate the transcription of MIDI sequences into guitar tablature. By framing the task as a symbolic translation problem, the model addresses key challenges, including string-fret ambiguity and physical playability. The proposed system leverages diverse datasets, including DadaGP, GuitarToday, and Leduc, with novel data pre-processing and tokenization strategies.

This work addresses that gap by introducing the Tensor Manipulation Unit (TMU), a reconfigurable, near-memory hardware block designed to efficiently execute data-movement-intensive operators. TMU manipulates long datastreams in a memory-to-memory fashion using a RISC-inspired execution model and a unified addressing abstraction, enabling broad support for both coarse- and fine-grained tensor transformations. Integrated alongside a TPU within a high-throughput AI SoC, the TMU leverages double buffering and output forwarding to improve pipeline utilization. Fabricated in SMIC 40nm technology, the TMU occupies only 0.019 mm2 while supporting over 10 representative tensor manipulation operators. Benchmarking shows that TMU alone achieves up to 1413 and 8.54 operator-level latency reduction compared to ARM A72 and NVIDIA Jetson TX2, respectively.

However, conventional SL frameworks' one-split-fits-all strategy is a critical limitation in agricultural ecosystems where edge insect monitoring devices exhibit vast heterogeneity in computational power, energy constraints, and connectivity. This leads to straggler bottlenecks, inefficient resource utilization, and compromised model performance. Bridging this gap, we introduce ReinDSplit, a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework that dynamically tailors DNN split points for each device, optimizing efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a Q-learning agent acts as an adaptive orchestrator, balancing workloads and latency thresholds across devices to mitigate computational starvation or overload. By framing split layer selection as a finite-state Markov decision process, ReinDSplit convergence ensures that highly constrained devices contribute meaningfully to model training over time. Evaluated on three insect classification datasets using ResNet18, GoogleNet, and MobileNetV2, ReinDSplit achieves 94.31% accuracy with MobileNetV2.

Accurately estimating the cardinality of a join operation -- analogous to its computational cost -- allows the optimization of query execution costs in relational database systems. However, although sketches have shown high efficacy in query optimization, they are typically constructed specifically for predefined selections in queries that are assumed to be given a priori, hindering their applicability to new queries. As a more general solution, we propose for Sum-Product Networks to dynamically approximate sketches on-the-fly. Sum-Product Networks can decompose and model multivariate distributions, such as relations, as linear combinations of multiple univariate distributions. By representing these univariate distributions as sketches, Sum-Product Networks can combine them element-wise to efficiently approximate the sketch of any query selection. These approximate sketches can then be applied to join cardinality estimation. In particular, we implement the Fast-AGMS and Bound Sketch methods, which have successfully been used in prior work, despite their costly construction. By accurately approximating them instead, our work provides a practical alternative to apply these sketches to query optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528Sum-Product Networks\u52a8\u6001\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8349\u56fe\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u8349\u56fe\u9700\u9884\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8def\u8fde\u63a5\u57fa\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8349\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u4f46\u9700\u9884\u5148\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u65b0\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Sum-Product Networks\u52a8\u6001\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8349\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u67e5\u8be2\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86Fast-AGMS\u548cBound Sketch\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8349\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8349\u56fe\u6280\u672f\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8def\u8fde\u63a5\u57fa\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce GG (Guaranteed Guess), an ISA-centric transpilation pipeline that combines the translation power of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with the rigor of established software testing constructs. Our method generates candidate translations using an LLM from one ISA to another, and embeds such translations within a software-testing framework to build quantifiable confidence in the translation. We evaluate our GG approach over two diverse datasets, enforce high code coverage (>98%) across unit tests, and achieve functional/semantic correctness of 99% on HumanEval programs and 49% on BringupBench programs, respectively. Further, we compare our approach to the state-of-the-art Rosetta 2 framework on Apple Silicon, showcasing 1.73x faster runtime performance, 1.47x better energy efficiency, and 2.41x better memory usage for our transpiled code, demonstrating the effectiveness of GG for real-world CISC-to-RISC translation tasks.

Since traditional methods heavily rely on feature extraction and large scale labeled data, some recent pre-trained models manage to reduce the dependency by utilizing different pre-training tasks to train generic representations for network packets. However, existing pre-trained models typically adopt pre-training tasks developed for image or text data, which are not tailored to traffic data. As a result, the obtained traffic representations fail to fully reflect the information contained in the traffic, and may even disrupt the protocol information. To address this, we propose TraGe, a novel generic packet representation model for traffic classification. Based on the differences between the header and payload-the two fundamental components of a network packet-we perform differentiated pre-training according to the byte sequence variations (continuous in the header vs. discontinuous in the payload). A dynamic masking strategy is further introduced to prevent overfitting to fixed byte positions.

However, current studies have limitations in modality selection, feature extraction and fusion, and co-inference for decision making, which restrict further improvement in the accuracy, applicability and reliability of multimodal fusion models. To address this problem, this study proposes a Multi-stage Augmented Multimodal Interaction Network (MAINet) for quantifying fish feeding intensity. Firstly, a general feature extraction framework is proposed to efficiently extract feature information from input image, audio and water wave datas. Second, an Auxiliary-modality Reinforcement Primary-modality Mechanism (ARPM) is designed for inter-modal interaction and generate enhanced features, which consists of a Channel Attention Fusion Network (CAFN) and a Dual-mode Attention Fusion Network (DAFN). Finally, an Evidence Reasoning (ER) rule is introduced to fuse the output results of each modality and make decisions, thereby completing the quantification of fish feeding intensity. The experimental results show that the constructed MAINet reaches 96.76%, 96.78%, 96.79% and 96.79% in accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score respectively, and its performance is significantly higher than the comparison models. Compared with models that adopt single-modality, dual-modality fusion and different decision-making fusion methods, it also has obvious advantages. Meanwhile, the ablation experiments further verified the key role of the proposed improvement strategy in improving the robustness and feature utilization efficiency of model, which can effectively improve the accuracy of the quantitative results of fish feeding intensity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MAINet\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u9c7c\u7c7b\u6444\u98df\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u63a8\u7406\u89c4\u5219\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u4ee5\u53ca\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7MAINet\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c7c\u7c7b\u6444\u98df\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u6846\u67b6\uff1b2) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u6001\u589e\u5f3a\u4e3b\u6a21\u6001\u673a\u5236\uff08ARPM\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CAFN\uff09\u548c\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DAFN\uff09\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u8bc1\u636e\u63a8\u7406\uff08ER\uff09\u89c4\u5219\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u6001\u7ed3\u679c\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "MAINet\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u523096.7%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MAINet\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u63a8\u7406\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9c7c\u7c7b\u6444\u98df\u5f3a\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c34\u4ea7\u517b\u6b96\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u6295\u5582\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we investigated content moderation policies and their enforcement in GAI online tools -- consumer-facing web-based GAI applications. We first analyzed content moderation policies of 14 GAI online tools. While these policies are comprehensive in outlining moderation practices, they usually lack details on practical implementations and are not specific about how users can aid in moderation or appeal moderation decisions.

Scaling ANNS to handle billions of high-dimensional vectors on a single machine presents significant challenges in memory capacity and processing efficiency. To address these challenges, distributed vector databases leverage multiple nodes for the parallel storage and processing of vectors. However, existing solutions often suffer from load imbalance and high communication overhead, primarily due to traditional partition strategies that fail to effectively distribute the workload. In this paper, we introduce Harmony, a distributed ANNS system that employs a novel multi-granularity partition strategy, combining dimension-based and vector-based partition. This strategy ensures a balanced distribution of computational load across all nodes while effectively minimizing communication costs. Furthermore, Harmony incorporates an early-stop pruning mechanism that leverages the monotonicity of distance computations in dimension-based partition, resulting in significant reductions in both computational and communication overhead. We conducted extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets, demonstrating that Harmony outperforms leading distributed vector databases, achieving 4.63 times throughput on average in four nodes and 58% performance improvement over traditional distribution for skewed workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHarmony\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u533a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u63d0\u524d\u505c\u6b62\u526a\u679d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\uff09\u5728\u5355\u673a\u4e0a\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u533a\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u533a\u548c\u5411\u91cf\u5206\u533a\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u524d\u505c\u6b62\u526a\u679d\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53474.63\u500d\uff0c\u5bf9\u503e\u659c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534758%\u3002", "conclusion": "Harmony\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u533a\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fANNS\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often rely on either high-poly mesh modeling with post-hoc simplification or massive 3D Gaussians, resulting in a complex pipeline or limited visual realism. In this paper, we demonstrate that such exhaustive modeling is unnecessary for achieving compelling immersive experience. We introduce ImmerseGen, a novel agent-guided framework for compact and photorealistic world modeling. ImmerseGen represents scenes as hierarchical compositions of lightweight geometric proxies, i.e., simplified terrain and billboard meshes, and generates photorealistic appearance by synthesizing RGBA textures onto these proxies. Specifically, we propose terrain-conditioned texturing for user-centric base world synthesis, and RGBA asset texturing for midground and foreground scenery.This reformulation offers several advantages: (i) it simplifies modeling by enabling agents to guide generative models in producing coherent textures that integrate seamlessly with the scene; (ii) it bypasses complex geometry creation and decimation by directly synthesizing photorealistic textures on proxies, preserving visual quality without degradation; (iii) it enables compact representations suitable for real-time rendering on mobile VR headsets. To automate scene creation from text prompts, we introduce VLM-based modeling agents enhanced with semantic grid-based analysis for improved spatial reasoning and accurate asset placement. ImmerseGen further enriches scenes with dynamic effects and ambient audio to support multisensory immersion. Experiments on scene generation and live VR showcases demonstrate that ImmerseGen achieves superior photorealism, spatial coherence and rendering efficiency compared to prior methods.

However, the process of offloading tasks to edge servers may expose vehicles to malicious external attacks, resulting in information loss or even tampering, thereby creating serious security vulnerabilities. Blockchain technology can maintain a shared ledger among servers. In the Raft consensus mechanism, as long as more than half of the nodes remain operational, the system will not collapse, effectively maintaining the system's robustness and security. To protect vehicle information, we propose a security framework that integrates the Raft consensus mechanism from blockchain technology with edge computing. To address the additional latency introduced by blockchain, we derived a theoretical formula for system delay and proposed a convex optimization solution to minimize the system latency, ensuring that the system meets the requirements for low latency and high reliability. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimized data extraction rate significantly reduces system delay, with relatively stable variations in latency. Moreover, the proposed optimization solution based on this model can provide valuable insights for enhancing security and efficiency in future network environments, such as 5G and next-generation smart city systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u533a\u5757\u94feRaft\u5171\u8bc6\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u62a4\u8f66\u8f86\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u964d\u4f4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8f66\u8054\u7f51\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u53ef\u80fd\u66b4\u9732\u8f66\u8f86\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u533a\u5757\u94feRaft\u5171\u8bc6\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u964d\u4f4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u7387\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4e14\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53d8\u5316\u76f8\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\uff08\u59825G\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u57ce\u5e02\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

To this end, we conducted a large-scale survey with over 1,000 participants. Overall, cybernetic avatars received a high level of acceptance, with physical robot avatars receiving higher acceptance than digital avatars. In terms of appearance, robot avatars with a highly anthropomorphic robotic appearance were the most accepted, followed by cartoonish designs and androids. Animal-like appearances received the lowest level of acceptance. Among the tasks, providing information and guidance was rated as the most valued. Shopping malls, airports, public transport stations, and museums were the settings with the highest acceptance, whereas healthcare-related spaces received lower levels of support. An analysis by community cluster revealed among others that Emirati respondents showed significantly greater acceptance of android appearances compared to the overall sample, while participants from the 'Other Asia' cluster were significantly more accepting of cartoonish appearances.

However, the variables quantifying nexus interactions are hard to observe, which hinders the cross-sector analysis. To overcome such challenges, we present FEWSim, a visual analytics framework designed to support domain experts in exploring and interpreting simulation results from a coupled FEW model. FEWSim employs a three-layer asynchronous architecture: the model layer integrates food, energy, and water models to simulate the FEW nexus; the middleware layer manages scenario configuration and execution; and the visualization layer provides interactive visual exploration of simulated time-series results across FEW sectors. The visualization layer further facilitates the exploration across multiple scenarios and evaluates scenario differences in performance using sustainability indices of the FEW nexus. We demonstrate the utility of FEWSim through a case study for the Phoenix Active Management Area (AMA) in Arizona.", "AI": {"tldr": "FEWSim\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e13\u5bb6\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u98df\u54c1\u3001\u80fd\u6e90\u548c\u6c34\uff08FEW\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76FEW\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5176\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u53d8\u91cf\u96be\u4ee5\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8de8\u90e8\u95e8\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86FEWSim\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u5c42\u5f02\u6b65\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u96c6\u6210FEW\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\u5c42\u7ba1\u7406\u573a\u666f\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e9a\u5229\u6851\u90a3\u5dde\u51e4\u51f0\u57ceAMA\uff09\u5c55\u793a\u4e86FEWSim\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FEWSim\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8de8\u90e8\u95e8\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86FEW\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

The inability to deliver information promptly can result in estimation errors that impact collaborative efforts among robots. In this paper, we propose a new metric termed Loss of Information Utility (LoIU) to quantify the freshness and utility of information critical for cooperation. The metric enables robots to prioritize information transmissions within bandwidth constraints. We also propose the estimation of LoIU using belief distributions and accordingly optimize both transmission schedule and resource allocation strategy for device-to-device transmissions to minimize the time-average LoIU within a robot team. A semi-decentralized Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient framework is developed, where each robot functions as an actor responsible for scheduling transmissions among its collaborators while a central critic periodically evaluates and refines the actors in response to mobility and interference.

Although trillions of dollars are laundered each year, only a small fraction is ever uncovered. This stems from a range of factors, including deliberate evasion by launderers, the rarity of confirmed cases, and the limited visibility each financial institution has into the global transaction network. While several synthetic datasets are available, they fail to model the structural and behavioral complexity of real-world money laundering. In particular, they often overlook partial observability, sparse and uncertain labels, strategic behavior, temporal dynamics, class imbalance, and network-level dependencies. To address these limitations, we present AMLGentex, an open-source suite for generating realistic, configurable transaction data and benchmarking detection methods. It enables systematic evaluation of anti-money laundering (AML) systems in a controlled environment that captures key real-world challenges.

In the present paper, we consider this issue from the point of view of enhancing linear logic with least and greatest fixed-points and considering such a variety of exponential connectives. Our main contribution is to provide a uniform cut-elimination theorem for a parametrized system with fixed-points by combining two approaches: cut-elimination proofs by reduction (or translation) to another system and the identification of sufficient conditions for cut-elimination. More precisely, we examine a broad range of systems, taking inspiration from Nigam and Miller's subexponentials and from Bauer and Laurent's super exponentials.

The ever-growing demand for latency-sensitive services and expanding user populations in next-generation 100G and beyond coherent PONs, underscores the crucial need for low-latency bandwidth management and efficient Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) mechanisms. In this paper, we present a pioneering analysis of two established DBAs from the perspective of temporal misalignments. Subsequently, a novel DBA algorithm tailored for coherent PONs featuring 100 Gbps data rate and up to 512 end-users is introduced, named the Hybrid-Switch DBA. This innovative approach allows for adaptive switching of the DBA scheme in response to real-time traffic conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first attempt to address the misalignment problem of DBA and proposes a novel DBA solution for both TDM- and TFDM-based coherent PON networks. This research significantly contributes to the development of coherent TDM PON and coherent TFDM PON networks by enhancing the efficiency of bandwidth allocation and addressing the challenges associated with misalignments in DBA mechanisms.

In this work, we present a novel methodology for refactoring Qiskit code using large language models (LLMs).

This taxonomy, along with the original Python source code, is provided as input to an LLM, which is then tasked with identifying instances of migration scenarios in the code and suggesting appropriate refactoring solutions. Our approach is designed to address the context length limitations of current LLMs by structuring the input and reasoning process in a targeted, efficient manner. The results demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by domain-specific migration knowledge, can effectively assist in automating Qiskit code migration.

Such interfaces are either built to serve specific scientific application needs (with limited coverage to the underlying MPI functionalities), or as an exercise in general-purpose programming model building, with the hope that bespoke interfaces can be broadly adopted to construct a variety of distributed-memory scientific applications. However, with the advent of modern C++-based heterogeneous programming models, GPUs and widespread Machine Learning (ML) usage in contemporary scientific computing, the role of prospective community-standardized high-level C++ interfaces to MPI is evolving. The success of such an interface clearly will depend on providing robust abstractions and features adhering to the generic programming principles that underpin the C++ programming language, without compromising on either performance and portability, the core principles upon which MPI was founded. However, there is a tension between idiomatic C++ handling of types and lifetimes, and, MPI's loose interpretation of object lifetimes/ownership and insistence on maintaining global states.\n  Instead of proposing \"yet another\" high-level C++ interface to MPI, overlooking or providing partial solutions to work around the key issues concerning the dissonance between MPI semantics and idiomatic C++, this paper focuses on the three fundamental aspects of a high-level interface: type system, object lifetimes and communication buffers, also identifying inconsistencies in the MPI specification. Presumptive solutions can be unrefined, and we hope the broader MPI and C++ communities will engage with us in productive exchange of ideas and concerns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3C++\u4e0eMPI\u8bed\u4e49\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u534f\u8c03\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u805a\u7126\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u5bf9\u8c61\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u73b0\u4ee3C++\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u7f16\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u793e\u533a\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u4e14\u7b26\u5408C++\u7f16\u7a0b\u539f\u5219\u7684MPI\u63a5\u53e3\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u805a\u7126\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u5bf9\u8c61\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522bMPI\u89c4\u8303\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u51fa\u5177\u4f53\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u547c\u5401MPI\u548cC++\u793e\u533a\u5171\u540c\u63a2\u8ba8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdC++ MPI\u63a5\u53e3\u9700\u5e73\u8861C++\u7f16\u7a0b\u539f\u5219\u4e0eMPI\u6838\u5fc3\u6027\u80fd/\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002"}}

The key observation behind Keigo is that there is no one-size-fits-all placement of data across the storage hierarchy that optimizes for all workloads. Hence, to leverage the benefits of combining different storage devices, Keigo places files across different devices based on their parallelism, I/O bandwidth, and capacity. We introduce three techniques - concurrency-aware data placement, persistent read-only caching, and context-based I/O differentiation. Keigo is portable across different LSMs, is adaptable to dynamic workloads, and does not require extensive profiling. Our system enables established production KVS such as RocksDB, LevelDB, and Speedb to benefit from heterogeneous storage setups. We evaluate Keigo using synthetic and realistic workloads, showing that it improves the throughput of production-grade LSMs up to 4x for write- and 18x for read-heavy workloads when compared to general-purpose storage systems and specialized LSM KVS.", "AI": {"tldr": "Keigo\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b58\u50a8\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u53d1\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316LSM KVS\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u5b58\u50a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LSM KVS\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u5b58\u50a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u653e\u7f6e\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u6240\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5e76\u53d1\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u653e\u7f6e\u3001\u6301\u4e45\u53ea\u8bfb\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684I/O\u533a\u5206\u4e09\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "Keigo\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bfb\u5199\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5199\u5165\u548c\u8bfb\u53d6\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u81f34\u500d\u548c18\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Keigo\u4e3a\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7LSM KVS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fbf\u643a\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u5b58\u50a8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we first extensively analyze the types of errors encountered during the function-calling process on several competitive tool evaluation benchmarks.

Building upon a novel evolutionary strategy for dataset construction, CRITICTOOL holds diverse tool-use errors with varying complexities, which better reflects real-world scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments on CRITICTOOL, and validate the generalization and effectiveness of our constructed benchmark strategy.

These methods remain a fundamental component of modern applications. However, animatable digital asset creation predominantly remains a manual process. Current automated tools often fall short of delivering the desired level of quality for intricate and complex geometries, requiring manual touch-ups. We propose a fully automatic and robust method for generating high quality skinning weights given a user-provided skeleton and mesh in A- or T-pose. Notably, our approach provides direct sparsity controls, limiting the number of bone influences per vertex, which is essential for efficient asset creation for large-scale mobile experiences with multiple concurrent users. Our method additionally addresses the need for level-of-detail (LoD) variations in performance-sensitive applications, which are exacerbated on mobile platforms. By optimizing weights in space rather than on discrete points, we enable a single optimization result to be seamlessly applied to all levels of detail of that asset or even variations of that asset. To achieve this, we introduce a novel parameterized family of functions called SkinCells. We demonstrate how our automatic method is able to robustly compute skinning weights in cases where biharmonic weight computation fails.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u76ae\u80a4\u6743\u91cd\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u9aa8\u67b6\u548c\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u591a\u7ea7\u522b\u7ec6\u8282\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u76ae\u80a4\u6743\u91cd\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e3a\u624b\u52a8\u6216\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u4f53\u4e0a\uff0c\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9896\u7684SkinCells\u51fd\u6570\u65cf\uff0c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u800c\u975e\u79bb\u6563\u70b9\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7a00\u758f\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u591a\u7ea7\u522b\u7ec6\u8282\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53cc\u8c03\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u5931\u8d25\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u9c81\u68d2\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76ae\u80a4\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SkinCells\u65b9\u6cd5\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u4f53\u7684\u76ae\u80a4\u6743\u91cd\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u591a\u7ea7\u522b\u7ec6\u8282\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, its substantial computational and energy requirements pose significant challenges. We introduce ASAP-FE (Agile Sparsity-Aware Parallelized-Feature Extractor), a hardware-oriented front-end designed to address these challenges. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) Half-overlapped Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Framing: This reduces redundant data by approximately 25% while maintaining essential phoneme transition cues. (2) Sparsity-aware Data Reduction: We exploit frame-level sparsity to achieve an additional 50% data reduction by combining frame skipping with stride-based filtering. (3) Dynamic Parallel Processing: We introduce a parameterizable filter cluster and a priority-based scheduling algorithm that allows parallel execution of IIR filtering tasks, reducing latency and optimizing energy efficiency. ASAP-FE is implemented with various filter cluster sizes on edge processors, with functionality verified on FPGA prototypes and designs synthesized at 45 nm. Experimental results using TC-ResNet8, DS-CNN, and KWT-1 demonstrate that ASAP-FE reduces the average workload by 62.73% while supporting real-time processing for up to 32 channels. Compared to a conventional fully overlapped baseline, ASAP-FE achieves less than a 1% accuracy drop (e.g., 96.22% vs. 97.13% for DS-CNN), which is well within acceptable limits for edge AI. By adjusting the number of filter modules, our design optimizes the trade-off between performance and energy, with 15 parallel filters providing optimal performance for up to 25 channels. Overall, ASAP-FE offers a practical and efficient solution for multi-channel KWS on energy-constrained edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "ASAP-FE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u591a\u901a\u9053\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u5524\u9192\u7cfb\u7edf\u524d\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u534a\u91cd\u53e0IIR\u5e27\u5904\u7406\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u591a\u901a\u9053\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u5524\u9192\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faASAP-FE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u534a\u91cd\u53e0IIR\u5e27\u5904\u7406\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u4e09\u5927\u521b\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aASAP-FE\u51cf\u5c11\u5e73\u574762.73%\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff0c\u652f\u630132\u901a\u9053\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u635f\u5931\u4f4e\u4e8e1%\u3002", "conclusion": "ASAP-FE\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u591a\u901a\u9053\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u5524\u9192\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, these memories are often scattered and difficult to organize into a coherent narrative, a challenge that defines the task of autobiography writing.

We introduce StorySage, a user-driven software system designed to meet the needs of a diverse group of users that supports a flexible conversation and a structured approach to autobiography writing. Powered by a multi-agent framework composed of an Interviewer, Session Scribe, Planner, Section Writer, and Session Coordinator, our system iteratively collects user memories, updates their autobiography, and plans for future conversations. In experimental simulations, StorySage demonstrates its ability to navigate multiple sessions and capture user memories across many conversations. User studies (N=28) highlight how StorySage maintains improved conversational flow, narrative completeness, and higher user satisfaction when compared to a baseline.

Runtime Verification (RV) checks events performed by a system against a formal specification of its intended behaviour, making it highly suitable for ensuring that an autonomous system is obeying its specification at runtime. Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) is a process algebra usually used in static verification, which captures behaviour as a trace of events, making it useful for RV as well. Further, CSP has more recently been used to specify autonomous and robotic systems. Though CSP is supported by two extant model checkers, so far it has no RV tool. This paper presents Varanus, an RV tool that monitors a system against an oracle built from a CSP specification. This approach enables the reuse without modifications of a specification that was built, e.g during the system's design. We describe the tool, apply it to a simulated autonomous robotic rover inspecting a nuclear waste store, empirically comparing its performance to two other RV tools using different languages, and demonstrate how it can detect violations of the specification. Varanus can synthesise a monitor from a CSP process in roughly linear time, with respect to the number of states and transitions in the model; and checks each event in roughly constant time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Varanus\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u57fa\u4e8eCSP\u89c4\u8303\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08RV\uff09\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u68c0\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u89c4\u8303\u3002", "method": "Varanus\u901a\u8fc7\u4eceCSP\u89c4\u8303\u751f\u6210\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "Varanus\u80fd\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u4eceCSP\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5408\u6210\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u63a5\u8fd1\u6052\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u89c4\u8303\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002", "conclusion": "Varanus\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86CSP\u89c4\u8303\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

A Gradient-Based Reward Policy Optimization mechanism further refines responses according to cultural alignment, affective appropriateness, and iterative user feedback. A Cultural-Aware Response Mediator coordinates knowledge retrieval, reinforcement learning updates, and historical data fusion. By merging real-time user input with past emotional states and cultural insights, Affective-CARA delivers narratives that are deeply personalized and sensitive to diverse cultural norms. Evaluations on AffectNet, SEMAINE DB, and MERD confirm that the framework consistently outperforms baseline models in sentiment alignment, cultural adaptation, and narrative quality. Affective-CARA achieved a Cultural Semantic Density of 9.32 out of 10 and lowered cultural representation bias by 61% (KL-Divergence: 0.28), demonstrating robust performance in generating ethical, adaptive responses.

Addressing these gaps, this paper extends our prior work on the Dynamic Management of Resources (DMR) framework, which provides a modular and user-friendly approach to dynamic resource allocation.

While traditional heuristic approaches and integer linear programming (ILP) methods have demonstrated efficacy for small to medium-scale problems, their scalability to large-scale instances remains unknown. Here, we introduce quantum annealing (QA) as a subroutine to tackling multi-objective SBSE problems, leveraging the computational potential of quantum systems. We propose two QA-based algorithms tailored to different problem scales. For small-scale problems, we reformulate multi-objective optimization (MOO) as single-objective optimization (SOO) using penalty-based mappings for quantum processing. For large-scale problems, we employ a decomposition strategy guided by maximum energy impact (MEI), integrating QA with a steepest descent method to enhance local search efficiency. Applied to NRP and FSP, our approaches are benchmarked against the heuristic NSGA-II and the ILP-based $\u03b5$-constraint method. Experimental results reveal that while our methods produce fewer non-dominated solutions than $\u03b5$-constraint, they achieve significant reductions in execution time. Moreover, compared to NSGA-II, our methods deliver more non-dominated solutions with superior computational efficiency.

These are nominal labelled transition systems which keep track of the history, i.e. of data values seen so far, and can capture fresh data generation. In particular, FLTSs generalise the computations of Fresh-Register Automata, which in turn are one of the simplest classes of history-dependent automata operating on infinite input alphabets. Each automaton comes equipped with a finite set of registers where it can store data values and compare them with others from the input. In addition, the automaton can accept an input just if it be fresh: not seen in the computation before. The logic we introduce can express a variety of properties, such as the existence of an infinite path of distinct data values or the existence of a finite path where some taint property is violated.

Additionally, our participants shared insights into improvements for existing mental health technologies, emphasizing the need for accessible, scalable, and personalized solutions that adapt to caregivers' changing needs over time.

However, the sheer volume of reviews available on app stores can lead to information overload, thus impeding users' ability to make informed app selection decisions. To address this challenge, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize mobile app reviews. In particular, we use the Chain of Density (CoD) prompt to guide OpenAI GPT-4 to generate abstractive, semantically dense, and easily interpretable summaries of mobile app reviews. The CoD prompt is engineered to iteratively extract salient entities from the source text and fuse them into a fixed-length summary. We evaluate the performance of our approach using a large dataset of mobile app reviews. We further conduct an empirical evaluation with 48 study participants to assess the readability of the generated summaries. Our results demonstrate that adapting the CoD prompt to focus on app features improves its ability to extract key themes from user reviews and generate natural language summaries tailored for end-user consumption. The prompt also manages to maintain the readability of the generated summaries while increasing their semantic density.

HEGNNs generalize subgraph-GNNs and form a hierarchy of increasingly expressive models that, in the limit, can distinguish graphs up to isomorphism. We provide a logical characterization of HEGNN node classifiers, with and without subgraph restrictions, using graded hybrid logic. This characterization enables us to relate the separating power of HEGNNs to that of higher-order GNNs, GNNs enriched with local homomorphism count features, and color refinement algorithms based on Individualization-Refinement. Our experimental results confirm the practical feasibility of HEGNNs and show benefits in comparison with traditional GNN architectures, both with and without local homomorphism count features.", "AI": {"tldr": "HEGNNs\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8282\u70b9\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u540c\u6784\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u56fe\u540c\u6784\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316-\u7ec6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHEGNNs\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8282\u70b9\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6269\u5c55GNNs\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5b50\u56fe\u9650\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "HEGNNs\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfGNNs\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HEGNNs\u4e3a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u3002"}}

To fill this gap, we conduct a controlled experiment with a representative sample of 680 U.S. participants in a realistic social media environment. The participants are randomly assigned to small discussion groups, each consisting of five individuals in one of five distinct experimental conditions: a control group and four treatment groups, each employing a unique AI intervention-chat assistance, conversation starters, feedback on comment drafts, and reply suggestions. Our findings highlight a complex duality: some AI-tools increase user engagement and volume of generated content, but at the same time decrease the perceived quality and authenticity of discussion, and introduce a negative spill-over effect on conversations. Based on our findings, we propose four design principles and recommendations aimed at social media platforms, policymakers, and stakeholders: ensuring transparent disclosure of AI-generated content, designing tools with user-focused personalization, incorporating context-sensitivity to account for both topic and user intent, and prioritizing intuitive user interfaces. These principles aim to guide an ethical and effective integration of generative AI into social media.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e2d\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u63d0\u9ad8\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u4f46\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5bb9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u9879\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f26\u7406\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6574\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u586b\u8865\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u5bf9\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u4ea7\u8005\u548c\u7528\u6237\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5305\u542b680\u540d\u7f8e\u56fd\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u548c\u56db\u79cdAI\u5e72\u9884\u7ec4\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0AI\u5de5\u5177\u867d\u589e\u52a0\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba8\u8bba\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u9879\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff1a\u900f\u660e\u62ab\u9732AI\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u5148\u76f4\u89c2\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u4f26\u7406\u6709\u6548\u7684AI\u6574\u5408\u3002"}}

While FL is unaffected by personalized model training, in Ditto, PL depends on the outcome of the FL. However, the clients' concern about their privacy and consequent perturbation of their local models can affect the convergence and (performance) fairness of PL. This paper presents PFL, called DP-Ditto, which is a non-trivial extension of Ditto under the protection of differential privacy (DP), and analyzes the trade-off among its privacy guarantee, model convergence, and performance distribution fairness. We also analyze the convergence upper bound of the personalized models under DP-Ditto and derive the optimal number of global aggregations given a privacy budget. Further, we analyze the performance fairness of the personalized models, and reveal the feasibility of optimizing DP-Ditto jointly for convergence and fairness. Experiments validate our analysis and demonstrate that DP-Ditto can surpass the DP-perturbed versions of the state-of-the-art PFL models, such as FedAMP, pFedMe, APPLE, and FedALA, by over 32.71% in fairness and 9.66% in accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "DP-Ditto\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1(DP)\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60(PFL)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709PFL\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDP-Ditto\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u4e0a\u754c\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u5408\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6536\u655b\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aDP-Ditto\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b32.71%\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u53479.66%\u3002", "conclusion": "DP-Ditto\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, in a short period, a wave of backlash has led many firms to re-assess their DEI strategies. Responding to this DEI backlash is crucial in academic research, especially because, currently, little scholarly research has been done on it. In this paper, therefore, we have set forth the following research question (RQ): \"How have leading software companies changed their DEI strategies in recent years?\" Given the novelty of the RQ and, consequently, the lack of scholarly research on it, we are conducting a grey literature study, examining the current state of DEI initiatives in 10 leading software companies. Based on our analysis, we have classified companies into categories based on their shift in commitment to DEI. We can identify that companies are indeed responding to the backlash by rethinking their strategy, either by reducing, increasing, or renaming their DEI initiatives. In contrast, some companies keep on with their DEI strategy, at least so far, despite the challenging political climate.

Therefore, we follow a different approach: We propose to enhance symbolic machine learning schemes by giving them access to neural embeddings. In the present paper, we show this for TILDE and embeddings of constants used by TILDE in similarity predicates. The approach can be fine-tuned by further refining the embeddings depending on the symbolic theory. In experiments in three real-world domain, we show that this simple, yet effective, approach outperforms all other baseline methods in terms of the F1 score.

As AI systems increasingly shape the informational substrate upon which human cognition operates, they transform from passive tools into active cognitive partners. Building on the Extended Mind hypothesis and Heersmink's criteria for cognitive extension, we argue that AI systems satisfy key conditions for cognitive integration. These include reliability, trust, transparency, individualization, and the ability to enhance and transform human mental functions. However, AI integration creates a paradox: while expanding cognitive capabilities, it may simultaneously constrain thinking through sycophancy and bias amplification. To address these challenges, we propose seven evidence-based frameworks for effective human-AI cognitive integration: Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding, which promotes progressive autonomy; Symbiotic Division of Cognitive Labor, strategically allocating tasks based on comparative strengths; Dialectical Cognitive Enhancement, countering AI sycophancy through productive epistemic tension; Agentic Transparency and Control, ensuring users understand and direct AI influence; Expertise Democratization, breaking down knowledge silos; Social-Emotional Augmentation, addressing affective dimensions of cognitive work; and Duration-Optimized Integration, managing the evolving human-AI relationship over time. Together, these frameworks provide a comprehensive approach for harnessing AI as a genuine cognitive extension while preserving human agency, critical thinking, and intellectual growth, transforming AI from a replacement for human cognition into a catalyst for enhanced thinking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86System 0\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u89e3AI\u5982\u4f55\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e03\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u4eba\u673a\u8ba4\u77e5\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u4ece\u5de5\u5177\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f19\u4f34\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u5fc3\u667a\u5047\u8bbe\u548cHeersmink\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6269\u5c55\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e03\u79cd\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u8ba4\u77e5\u6574\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6ee1\u8db3\u8ba4\u77e5\u6574\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u6846\u67b6\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e03\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\u65e8\u5728\u5c06AI\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u3002"}}

This study provides a rigorous evaluation of consensus power inequality across five prominent blockchain networks - Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Hedera, and Algorand - using data collected from January 2022 to July 2024. Leveraging established economic metrics, including the Gini coefficient and Theil index, the research quantitatively assesses how power is distributed among blockchain network participants. A robust dataset, capturing network-specific characteristics such as mining pools, staking patterns, and consensus nodes, forms the foundation of the analysis, enabling meaningful comparisons across diverse architectures. Through an in-depth comparative study, the paper identifies key disparities in consensus power distribution. Hedera and Bitcoin demonstrate more balanced power distribution, aligning closely with the principles of decentralisation. Ethereum and Cardano demonstrate moderate levels of inequality. However, contrary to expectations, Ethereum has become more concentrated following its transition to Proof-of-Stake. Meanwhile, Algorand shows a pronounced centralisation of power. Moreover, the findings highlight the structural and operational drivers of inequality, including economic barriers, governance models, and network effects, offering actionable insights for more equitable network design. This study establishes a methodological framework for evaluating blockchain consensus power inequality, emphasising the importance of targeted strategies to ensure fairer power distribution and enhancing the sustainability of decentralised systems.

Despite notable advances in automatic ME recognition (MER), existing methods still struggle to jointly capture localized muscle activations and global facial dependencies, both critical for recognizing subtle emotional cues. To tackle this challenge, we propose MERba, a novel multi-receptive field architecture tailored for MER. MERba introduces a series of Local-Global Feature Integration stages, where fine-grained motion features are first extracted by local extractors containing MambaVision Mixers within non-overlapping windows, and then global dependencies across these regions are modeled via lightweight self-attention layers. This hierarchical design enables a progressive transition from localized perception to holistic facial understanding. Furthermore, we introduce an asymmetric multi-scanning strategy to eliminate redundant scanning directions and enhance local spatial perception. To address the high inter-class similarity among negative MEs, we introduce a Dual-Granularity Classification Module that decouples the recognition process into a coarse-to-fine paradigm.

Accepted to AJ", "summary": "SETI@home is a radio Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project, looking for technosignatures in data recorded at multiple observatories from 1998 to 2020. Most radio SETI projects analyze data using dedicated processing hardware. SETI@home uses a different approach: time-domain data is distributed over the Internet to $\\gt 10^{5}$ volunteered home computers, which analyze it. The large amount of computing power this affords ($\\sim 10^{15}$ floating-point operations per second (FPOP/s)) allows us to increase the sensitivity and generality of our search in three ways. We use coherent integration, a technique in which data is transformed so that the power of drifting signals is confined to a single discrete Fourier transform (DFT) bin. We perform this coherent search over 123 000 Doppler drift rates in the range ($\\pm$100 Hz s$^{-1}$). Second, we search for a variety of signal types, such as pulsed signals and arbitrary repeated waveforms. The analysis uses a range of DFT sizes, with frequency resolutions ranging from 0.075 Hz to 1221 Hz. The front end of SETI@home produces a set of detections that exceed thresholds in power and goodness of fit. We accumulated $\\sim 1.2\\times 10^{10}$ such detections. The back end of SETI@home takes these detections, identifies and removes radio frequency interference (RFI), and looks for groups of detections that are consistent with extraterrestrial origin and that persist over long timescales.

However, these predicted fragments already contain bugs. Thus, the current bug prediction approaches support fixing rather than prevention. The aim of this paper is to introduce and evaluate Ticket-Level Prediction (TLP), an approach to identify tickets that will introduce bugs once implemented. We analyze TLP at three temporal points, each point represents a ticket lifecycle stage: Open, In Progress, or Closed. We conjecture that: (1) TLP accuracy increases as tickets progress towards the closed stage due to improved feature reliability over time, and (2) the predictive power of features changes across these temporal points. Our TLP approach leverages 72 features belonging to six different families: code, developer, external temperature, internal temperature, intrinsic, ticket to tickets, and JIT. Our TLP evaluation uses a sliding-window approach, balancing feature selection and three machine-learning bug prediction classifiers on about 10,000 tickets of two Apache open-source projects. Our results show that TLP accuracy increases with proximity, confirming the expected trade-off between early prediction and accuracy. Regarding the prediction power of feature families, no single feature family dominates across stages; developer-centric signals are most informative early, whereas code and JIT metrics prevail near closure, and temperature-based features provide complementary value throughout. Our findings complement and extend the literature on bug prediction at the class, method, or commit level by showing that defect prediction can be effectively moved upstream, offering opportunities for risk-aware ticket triaging and developer assignment before any code is written.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7968\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\uff08TLP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5de5\u5355\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTLP\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u968f\u7740\u5de5\u5355\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u63a8\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u5bb6\u65cf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u4fee\u590d\u800c\u975e\u9884\u9632\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u524d\u5230\u5de5\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528TLP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5355\u768472\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5c5e\u4e8e6\u5927\u7c7b\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5bf9\u4e24\u4e2aApache\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u768410,000\u4e2a\u5de5\u5355\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "TLP\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u968f\u5de5\u5355\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u63a8\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u540c\uff1a\u65e9\u671f\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7279\u5f81\u6700\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u4ee3\u7801\u548cJIT\u6307\u6807\u5360\u4f18\uff0c\u6e29\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5168\u7a0b\u8865\u5145\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7f3a\u9677\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u63d0\u524d\u81f3\u5de5\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e3a\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5de5\u5355\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5206\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

Simulating social media behaviors provides a robust tool for capturing the patterns of social media behaviors, testing hypotheses, and predicting the effects of various interventions, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of social media environments. Moreover, it can overcome difficulties associated with utilizing real data for analysis, such as data accessibility issues, ethical concerns, and the complexity of processing large and heterogeneous datasets. However, researchers and stakeholders need more flexible platforms to investigate different user behaviors by simulating different scenarios and characters, which is not possible yet. Therefore, this paper introduces SimSpark, an interactive system including simulation algorithms and interactive visual interfaces which is capable of creating small simulated social media platforms with customizable characters and social environments. We address three key challenges: generating believable behaviors, validating simulation results, and supporting interactive control for generation and results analysis. A simulation workflow is introduced to generate believable behaviors of agents by utilizing large language models. A visual interface enables real-time parameter adjustment and process monitoring for customizing generation settings. A set of visualizations and interactions are also designed to display the models' outputs for further analysis.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in this domain, leveraging their extensive knowledge to produce test code more efficiently. This study investigates the quality of Python test code generated by three LLMs: GPT-4o, Amazon Q, and LLama 3.3. We evaluate the structural reliability of test suites generated under two distinct prompt contexts: Text2Code (T2C) and Code2Code (C2C). Our analysis includes the identification of errors and test smells, with a focus on correlating these issues to inadequate design patterns. Our findings reveal that most test suites generated by the LLMs contained at least one error or test smell. Assertion errors were the most common, comprising 64% of all identified errors, while the test smell Lack of Cohesion of Test Cases was the most frequently detected (41%). Prompt context significantly influenced test quality; textual prompts with detailed instructions often yielded tests with fewer errors but a higher incidence of test smells. Among the evaluated LLMs, GPT-4o produced the fewest errors in both contexts (10% in C2C and 6% in T2C), whereas Amazon Q had the highest error rates (19% in C2C and 28% in T2C). For test smells, Amazon Q had fewer detections in the C2C context (9%), while LLama 3.3 performed best in the T2C context (10%). Additionally, we observed a strong relationship between specific errors, such as assertion or indentation issues, and test case cohesion smells.

This paper analyzes interviews with hardware and software engineers, and their collaborators, who work in integrated circuit design to identify the role accuracy plays in their use of generative AI tools and what other forms of trouble they face in using such tools. The paper inventories these forms of trouble, which are then mapped to elements of generative AI systems, to conclude that controlling the context of interactions between engineers and the generative AI tools is one of the largest challenges they face. The paper concludes with recommendations for mitigating this form of trouble by increasing the ability to control context interactively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9886\u57df\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5982\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u8b66\u60d5\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbf\u8c08\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u53ca\u5176\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a7\u5236\u96be\u9898\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u9762\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u53ca\u5176\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5404\u4e2a\u8981\u7d20\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u7684\u6311\u6218\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The course has undergone fundamental changes since 2020 to make the teaching approach more student-centred and flexible. As many universities abandoned having face-to-face exams at the end of the semester, authentic assessments now play an even more important role than before. This makes assessment of students' work even more challenging, especially if we are dealing with large cohorts of students. The complexity is not only in dealing with diversity in the student cohorts when elaborating the assessment tasks, but also in being able to provide feedback and marks in a timely and fairly. We report our lessons learned, which might provide useful insights for teaching Agile/Scrum concepts to undergraduate and postgraduate students. We also analyse what course structure might be effective to support a blended learning approach, as well as what could be a reasonable structure of online assessments, to keep them both authentic and scalable for large cohorts of students.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6559\u6388\u4ee5\u654f\u6377/Scrum\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u9879\u76ee\u7ba1\u7406\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u6311\u6218\u4e0e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u75ab\u60c5\u540e\u6559\u5b66\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u5982\u53d6\u6d88\u9762\u5bf9\u9762\u8003\u8bd5\uff09\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b66\u751f\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u4f5c\u4e1a\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ca\u65f6\u516c\u6b63\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u6210\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91c7\u7528\u5b66\u751f\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6ce8\u91cd\u654f\u6377/Scrum\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\u652f\u6301\u6df7\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u6559\u5b66\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u672c\u79d1\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u7684\u654f\u6377/Scrum\u6559\u5b66\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b66\u751f\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u6df7\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b66\u751f\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

Our experiments show that giving MLLMs exactly the same study information as trained human participants results in a similar performance to human experts and exceeds the performance of untrained non-experts. Additionally, we show that prompt engineering that deviates from the human-subject experiment can lead to better-than-human performance in some settings. Interestingly, like human subjects, the MLLMs seem to rely on visual proxies rather than computing the actual value of stress, indicating some sense or facsimile of perception.

A Call to Embrace Rebound Effects in Sustainable HCI", "categories": ["cs.HC"], "comment": "25 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "As part of global climate action, digital technologies are seen as a key enabler of energy efficiency savings. A popular application domain for this work is smart homes. There is a risk, however, that these efficiency gains result in rebound effects, which reduce or even overcompensate the savings. Rebound effects are well-established in economics, but it is less clear whether they also inform smart energy research in other disciplines. In this paper, we ask: to what extent have rebound effects and their underlying mechanisms been considered in computing, HCI and smart home research?

While these methods yield rich insights, they are time-consuming and require intensive expert intervention. Recent technological advances, including vision-language models (VLMs), have begun to automate parts of this process; however, existing efforts are often ad hoc and lack adaptability across research designs and geographic contexts. In this demo paper, we present StreetLens, a human-centered, researcher-configurable workflow that embeds relevant social science expertise in a VLM for scalable neighborhood environmental assessments. StreetLens mimics the process of trained human coders by grounding the analysis in questions derived from established interview protocols, retrieving relevant street view imagery (SVI), and generating a wide spectrum of semantic annotations from objective features (e.g., the number of cars) to subjective perceptions (e.g., the sense of disorder in an image). By enabling researchers to define the VLM's role through domain-informed prompting, StreetLens places domain knowledge at the core of the analysis process. It also supports the integration of prior survey data to enhance robustness and expand the range of characteristics assessed across diverse settings. We provide a Google Colab notebook to make StreetLens accessible and extensible for researchers working with public or custom SVI datasets. StreetLens represents a shift toward flexible, agentic AI systems that work closely with researchers to accelerate and scale neighborhood studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "StreetLens\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u793e\u533a\u73af\u5883\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u793e\u533a\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002StreetLens\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684VLM\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "StreetLens\u7ed3\u5408\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528VLM\u751f\u6210\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "StreetLens\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5ba2\u89c2\u7279\u5f81\u5230\u4e3b\u89c2\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5730\u7406\u73af\u5883\u3002", "conclusion": "StreetLens\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u5d4c\u5165AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u793e\u533a\u7814\u7a76\u5411\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

The framework overcomes key limitations in prior sign language technologies by enabling direct user inspection and modification of sign segments, thus enhancing naturalness, expressiveness, and user agency. Leveraging a streaming Conformer encoder and autoregressive Transformer-MDN decoder, the system synchronizes spoken input into upper-body and facial motion for 3D avatar rendering. Edits and user ratings feed into a human-in-the-loop optimization loop for continuous improvement. Experiments with 20 deaf signers and 5 interpreters show that the editable interface and participatory feedback significantly improve comprehension, naturalness, usability, and trust, while lowering cognitive load. With sub-20 ms per-frame inference on standard hardware, the system is ready for real-time communication and education.

This study investigates how the warm-glow phenomenon, the positive feeling associated with doing good, shapes perceived usability. An experimental approach was taken in which participants evaluated a hypothetical technology under conditions designed to evoke either the intrinsic (i.e., personal fulfillment) or extrinsic (i.e., social recognition) dimensions of warm-glow. A Multivariate Analysis of Variance as well as subsequent follow-up analyses revealed that intrinsic warm-glow significantly enhances all dimensions of perceived usability, while extrinsic warm-glow selectively influences perceived effectiveness and satisfaction. These findings suggest that perceptions of usability extend beyond functionality and are shaped by how technology resonates with users' broader sense of purpose. We conclude by proposing that designers consider incorporating warm-glow into technology as a strategic design decision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u6355\u6349\u6280\u672f\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u201c\u6e29\u6696\u6548\u5e94\u201d\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6280\u672f\u9010\u6e10\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u4eba\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u9002\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30\u5047\u8bbe\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bf1\u53d1\u5185\u5728\u6216\u5916\u5728\u6e29\u6696\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5185\u5728\u6e29\u6696\u6548\u5e94\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u6240\u6709\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5916\u5728\u6548\u5e94\u4ec5\u5f71\u54cd\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u5c06\u6e29\u6696\u6548\u5e94\u878d\u5165\u6280\u672f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7528\u6237\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

This study investigates potential factors contributing to patterns of AI reliance among undergraduate students, examining not only overreliance but also appropriate reliance (correctly accepting helpful and rejecting harmful recommendations) and underreliance (incorrectly rejecting helpful recommendations). Our approach combined pre- and post-surveys with a controlled experimental task where participants solved programming problems with an AI assistant that provided both accurate and deliberately incorrect suggestions, allowing direct observation of students' reliance patterns when faced with varying AI reliability. We find that appropriate reliance is significantly related to students' programming self-efficacy, programming literacy, and need for cognition, while showing negative correlations with post-task trust and satisfaction. Overreliance showed significant correlations with post-task trust and satisfaction with the AI assistant.

However, software engineering is more than coding and is concerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project. In this context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs as reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously. But is an LLM agent the same as an AI software engineer? In this paper, we seek to understand this question by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent. Unlike existing work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such as testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which can orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities. This gives the agent the promise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an incomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others. We envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which can be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and humans. To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software Engineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding, testing, and patching.

To understand which retraining techniques should be considered when designing sustainable ML applications, in this work, we study the energy consumption of common retraining techniques. Since the accuracy of ML systems is also essential, we compare retraining techniques in terms of both energy efficiency and accuracy. We showcase that retraining with only the most recent data, compared to all available data, reduces energy consumption by up to 25\\%, being a sustainable alternative to the status quo. Furthermore, our findings show that retraining a model only when there is evidence that updates are necessary, rather than on a fixed schedule, can reduce energy consumption by up to 40\\%, provided a reliable data change detector is in place.

However, when a pretrained policy makes errors during deployment, there are limited mechanisms for users to correct its behavior. While collecting additional data for finetuning can address such issues, doing so for each downstream use case is inefficient at deployment. My research proposes an alternative: keeping pretrained policies frozen as a fixed skill repertoire while allowing user interactions to guide behavior generation toward user preferences at inference time. By making pretrained policies steerable, users can help correct policy errors when the model struggles to generalize-without needing to finetune the policy. Specifically, I propose (1) inference-time steering, which leverages user interactions to switch between discrete skills, and (2) task and motion imitation, which enables user interactions to edit continuous motions while satisfying task constraints defined by discrete symbolic plans. These frameworks correct misaligned policy predictions without requiring additional training, maximizing the utility of pretrained models while achieving inference-time user objectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6307\u5bfc\u884c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u6536\u96c6\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5207\u6362\u79bb\u6563\u6280\u80fd\uff09\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u4eff\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u7f16\u8f91\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u4f5c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fee\u6b63\u7b56\u7565\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7528\u6237\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

The Surprising Impact of Hybrid Graph Representations on Code Clone Detection", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.SE"], "comment": null, "summary": "As one of the most detrimental code smells, code clones significantly increase software maintenance costs and heighten vulnerability risks, making their detection a critical challenge in software engineering. Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) dominate deep learning-based code clone detection due to their precise syntactic structure representation, but they inherently lack semantic depth. Recent studies address this by enriching AST-based representations with semantic graphs, such as Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) and Data Flow Graphs (DFGs). However, the effectiveness of various enriched AST-based representations and their compatibility with different graph-based machine learning techniques remains an open question, warranting further investigation to unlock their full potential in addressing the complexities of code clone detection. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of AST-based hybrid graph representations in Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based code clone detection. We systematically compare various hybrid representations ((CFG, DFG, Flow-Augmented ASTs (FA-AST)) across multiple GNN architectures. Our experiments reveal that hybrid representations impact GNNs differently: while AST+CFG+DFG consistently enhances accuracy for convolution- and attention-based models (Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT)), FA-AST frequently introduces structural complexity that harms performance. Notably, GMN outperforms others even with standard AST representations, highlighting its superior cross-code similarity detection and reducing the need for enriched structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eAST\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5728GNN\u4ee3\u7801\u514b\u9686\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540cGNN\u67b6\u6784\u5f71\u54cd\u5404\u5f02\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dAST+CFG+DFG\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u76ca\uff0c\u800cFA-AST\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u590d\u6742\u6027\u635f\u5bb3\u6027\u80fd\u3002GMN\u5728\u6807\u51c6AST\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7801\u514b\u9686\u589e\u52a0\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5176\u68c0\u6d4b\u662f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709AST\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u6df7\u5408\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u4e0eGNN\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff08AST+CFG+DFG\u3001FA-AST\u7b49\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540cGNN\u67b6\u6784\uff08GCN\u3001GAT\u3001GMN\u7b49\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "AST+CFG+DFG\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u800cFA-AST\u5e38\u56e0\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002GMN\u5728\u6807\u51c6AST\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u6548\u679c\u56e0GNN\u67b6\u6784\u800c\u5f02\uff0cGMN\u5728\u6807\u51c6AST\u4e0b\u5df2\u8db3\u591f\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}
