Motivation: 了解移动应用需求工程研究中数据集来源及其对研究活动的影响，填补现有知识空白。

Method: 采用Kitchenham等人的系统映射研究方法，分析了43篇相关论文。

Result: 90%的研究数据集来自Google Play和Apple App Store，需求获取和分析是最常研究的活动。

Conclusion: 需多样化数据源和研究活动以避免结果偏差，并推动更具普适性的研究成果。

Abstract: [Background] Research on requirements engineering (RE) for mobile apps
employs datasets formed by app users, developers or vendors. However, little is
known about the sources of these datasets in terms of platforms and the RE
activities that were researched with the help of the respective datasets.
[Aims] The goal of this paper is to investigate the state-of-the-art of the
datasets of mobile apps used in existing RE research. [Method] We carried out a
systematic mapping study by following the guidelines of Kitchenham et al.
[Results] Based on 43 selected papers, we found that Google Play and Apple App
Store provide the datasets for more than 90% of published research in RE for
mobile apps. We also found that the most investigated RE activities - based on
datasets, are requirements elicitation and requirements analysis. [Conclusions]
Our most important conclusions are: (1) there is a growth in the use of
datasets for RE research of mobile apps since 2012, (2) the RE knowledge for
mobile apps might be skewed due to the overuse of Google Play and Apple App
Store, (3) there are attempts to supplement reviews of apps from repositories
with other data sources, (4) there is a need to expand the alternative sources
and experiments with complimentary use of multiple sources, if the community
wants more generalizable results. Plus, it is expected to expand the research
on other RE activities, beyond elicitation and analysis.
