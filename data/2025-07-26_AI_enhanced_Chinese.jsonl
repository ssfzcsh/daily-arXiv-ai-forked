In recent years, the rise of\nlanguages with quantitative (e.g.~probabilistic) features has led to extensions\nof coinductive methods to more refined types of behavioural conformances, most\nnotably notions of behavioural distance. To guarantee soundness of coinductive\nreasoning, one needs to show that the behavioural conformance at hand forms a\nprogram congruence, i.e. it is suitably compatible with the operations of the\nlanguage. This is usually achieved by a complex proof technique known as\n\\emph{Howe's method}, which needs to be carefully adapted to both the specific\nlanguage and the targeted notion of behavioural conformance. We develop a\nuniform categorical approach to Howe's method that features two orthogonal\ndimensions of abstraction: (1) the underlying higher-order language is modelled\nby an \\emph{abstract higher-order specification} (AHOS), a novel and very\ngeneral categorical account of operational semantics, and (2) notions of\nbehavioural conformance (such as relations or metrics) are modelled via\nfibrations over the base category of an AHOS. Our main result is a fundamental\ncongruence theorem at this level of generality: Under natural conditions on the\ncategorical ingredients and the operational rules of a language modelled by an\nAHOS, the greatest behavioural (bi)conformance on its operational model forms a\ncongruence.

Recognized as a student-centered pedagogical approach,\nPjBL has the potential to enhance student motivation, engagement, critical\nthinking, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. Despite these benefits,\nfaculty adoption remains inconsistent due to challenges such as insufficient\ninstitutional support, time constraints, limited training opportunities,\ndesigning or sourcing projects, and aligning them with course objectives. This\nresearch explores these barriers and investigates the strategies and resources\nthat facilitate a successful adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, data\nfrom 80 computing faculty were collected through an online survey comprising\nclosed-ended questions to quantify barriers, enablers, and resource needs,\nalong with an open-ended question to gather qualitative insights. Quantitative\ndata were analyzed using statistical methods, while qualitative responses\nunderwent thematic analysis. Results reveal that while PjBL is widely valued,\nits adoption is often selective and impacted by challenges in planning and\nmanaging the learning process, designing suitable projects, and a lack of\ninstitutional support, such as time, funding, and teaching assistants. Faculty\nare more likely to adopt or sustain PjBL when they have access to peer\ncollaboration, professional development, and institutional incentives.

These applications have diverse token-generation latency\nrequirements. As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive\n(LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive\ncategory and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling\nopportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO\nrequirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch\ngenerate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct\nSLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for\nhandling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates\nfine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE\nscenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO\nattainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot\ntolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO\nscheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing\nthroughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their\nper-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the\nserver fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still\nSLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling.\nTo increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share\ntighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated. PolyServe uses\nprofiling data to guide scheduling decisions and manage tail latency through\nrequest-wait-time-aware scheduling, dynamic chunking, and continuous chunked\nprefill prediction.

It enables teams to develop,\ntest, and deliver software rapidly and collaboratively. Among CI services,\nGitHub Actions (GHA) has emerged as a dominant service due to its deep\nintegration with GitHub and a vast ecosystem of reusable workflow actions.\nAlthough GHA provides official documentation and community-supported best\npractices, there appears to be limited empirical understanding of how\nopen-source real-world CI workflows align with such practices. Many workflows\nmight be unnecessarily complex and not aligned with the simplicity goals of CI\npractices. This study will investigate the structure, complexity,\nheterogeneity, and compliance of GHA workflows in open-source software\nrepositories.

GeoAvatar leverages Adaptive Pre-allocation\nStage (APS), an unsupervised method that segments Gaussians into rigid and\nflexible sets for adaptive offset regularization. Then, based on mouth anatomy\nand dynamics, we introduce a novel mouth structure and the part-wise\ndeformation strategy to enhance the animation fidelity of the mouth. Finally,\nwe propose a regularization loss for precise rigging between Gaussians and 3DMM\nfaces. Moreover, we release DynamicFace, a video dataset with highly expressive\nfacial motions. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GeoAvatar\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and novel animation\nscenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGeoAvatar\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51e0\u4f55\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u89e3\u51b33D\u5934\u90e8\u5316\u8eab\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9762\u90e8\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\u51e0\u4f55\u504f\u5dee\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u52a8\u753b\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "GeoAvatar\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u5206\u914d\u9636\u6bb5\uff08APS\uff09\u5206\u5272\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5634\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5206\u533a\u53d8\u5f62\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u65af\u4e0e3DMM\u9762\u90e8\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u7ed1\u5b9a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eGeoAvatar\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u65b0\u52a8\u753b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GeoAvatar\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51e0\u4f55\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5634\u90e8\u53d8\u5f62\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u5934\u90e8\u5316\u8eab\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u52a8\u753b\u96be\u9898\u3002"}}

It is, however, very challenging to\nachieve massive scalability in LPWANs, where numerous sensors can transmit data\nefficiently and with low latency, which emerging IoT and CPS applications may\nrequire. In this paper, we address the above challenges by significantly\nadvancing an LPWAN technology called SNOW. SNOW exploits distributed orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing, D-OFDM, subcarriers to enable parallel\nreception of data to a BS from multiple asynchronous sensors, each using a\ndifferent subcarrier. In this paper, we achieve massive scalability in SNOW by\nenabling the BS to decode concurrent data from numerous asynchronous sensors on\nthe same subcarrier while parallelly decoding from other subcarriers as well.\nAdditionally, we enable numerous asynchronous sensors to receive distinct data\nfrom the BS on the same subcarrier while other sensors also receive data\nparallelly on other subcarriers. To do this, we develop a set of Gold\ncode-based pseudorandom noise or PN sequences that are mutually non-interfering\nwithin and across the subcarriers. Each sensor uses its PN sequence from the\nset for encoding or decoding data on its subcarriers, enabling massive\nconcurrency. Our evaluation results demonstrate that we can achieve\napproximately 9x more scalability in SNOW while being timely in data collection\nat the BS and energy efficient at the sensors.

As these systems proliferate,\nunderstanding the risks associated with their complex supply chains is\nincreasingly important. LLM-based systems are not standalone as they rely on\ninterconnected supply chains involving pretrained models, third-party\nlibraries, datasets, and infrastructure. Yet, most risk assessments narrowly\nfocus on model or data level, overlooking broader supply chain vulnerabilities.\nWhile recent studies have begun to address LLM supply chain risks, there\nremains a lack of benchmarks for systematic research.\n  To address this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive dataset for\nanalyzing and benchmarking LLM supply chain security. We collect 3,859\nreal-world LLM applications and perform interdependency analysis, identifying\n109,211 models, 2,474 datasets, and 9,862 libraries. We extract model\nfine-tuning paths, dataset reuse, and library reliance, mapping the ecosystem's\nstructure. To evaluate security, we gather 1,555 risk-related issues-50 for\napplications, 325 for models, 18 for datasets, and 1,229 for libraries from\npublic vulnerability databases.\n  Using this dataset, we empirically analyze component dependencies and risks.\nOur findings reveal deeply nested dependencies in LLM applications and\nsignificant vulnerabilities across the supply chain, underscoring the need for\ncomprehensive security analysis.

This results in unfair access to network resources,\npotentially influencing driving safety. To ensure the freshness of received\ndata, the AoI should be analyzed. Mode 2 introduces a novel preemption\nmechanism, necessitating simultaneous optimization of fair access and AoI to\nguarantee timely and relevant data delivery.

First, an encoder\nblock converts the operands from a two's complement to a sign magnitude\nrepresentation, followed by a multiplier module which performs the compute\noperation and outputs the resulting value in the original format. This allows\nto leverage the power-efficiency of the Sign Magnitude encoding for the\nmultiplication. To ensure the computing format is not altered, those two\ncomponents are synthesized and optimized separately. Our method leads to\nsignificant power savings for input values centered around zero, as commonly\nencountered in AI workloads. Under a realistic input stream with values\nnormally distributed with a standard deviation of 3.0, post-synthesis\nsimulations of the 4-bit multiplier design show up to 12.9% lower switching\nactivity compared to synthesis without decomposition. Those gains are achieved\nwhile ensuring compliance into any production-ready system as the overall\ncircuit stays logic-equivalent. With the compliance lifted and a slightly\nsmaller input range of -7 to +7, switching activity reductions can reach up to\n33%.

We employ the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator\nand aim to devise a transmission policy to optimize estimation performance\nsubject to a transmission frequency constraint. We leverage two metrics, namely\nthe Age of Consecutive Error (AoCE) and the Age of Information (AoI), to\nquantify, respectively, the significance of estimation error at the transmitter\nand the predictability of outdated information at the receiver. The optimal\ntransmission problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process\n(CMDP) with unbounded costs. We show the existence of an optimal simple mixture\npolicy, which randomly selects between two deterministic switching policies\nwith a fixed probability. Notably, each switching policy triggers a\ntransmission only when the AoCE exceeds a threshold value that depends on both\nthe AoI and the instantaneous estimation error. We further derive sufficient\nconditions under which the switching policy reduces to a simple threshold\npolicy; that is, it admits identical thresholds for all estimation errors.\nLeveraging these results, we develop an efficient structure-aware algorithm,\nInsec-SPI, that computes the optimal policy with reduced computation overhead.\nOur results demonstrate that incorporating both AoI and AoCE yields\nsignificantly improved estimation quality compared to using either metric\nalone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u8fdc\u7a0b\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMAP\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408AoCE\u548cAoI\u4f18\u5316\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5Insec-SPI\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408AoCE\u548cAoI\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8fdc\u7a0b\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528MAP\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528AoCE\u548cAoI\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u9648\u65e7\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CMDP\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5Insec-SPI\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408AoCE\u548cAoI\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u4e00\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8fdc\u7a0b\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This is due\nto the limited power supplied by regional grids that leads to limited regional\ncomputational power. Consequently, distributing training workloads across\ngeographically distributed sites has become essential. However, this approach\nintroduces a significant challenge in the form of communication overhead,\ncreating a fundamental trade-off between the performance gains from accessing\ngreater aggregate power and the performance losses from increased network\nlatency. Although prior work has focused on reducing communication volume or\nusing heuristics for distribution, these methods assume constant homogeneous\npower supplies and ignore the challenge of heterogeneous power availability\nbetween sites.\n  To address the challenge of training large models in power-constrained,\ngeo-distributed environments, we introduce PowerTrip, a system that dynamically\nselects a subset of sites during runtime to optimize the power-communication\ntrade-off. Specifically, PowerTrip selects sites based on a power-to-cost\nheuristic, prioritizing those with high power availability and low network\nlatency. PowerTrip employs a dynamic greedy approach and uses the marginal gain\nin training efficiency, i.e., accuracy improvement per unit of time, to\noptimize for the number of sites where the performance penalty from network\noverhead negates the benefit of adding more computational power.

R2 was used as a confidence\nmetric to measure the accuracy of the algorithm, and its classification\nperformance was analyzed using naturalistic collision avoidance data of both\nADS and humans, where our method was validated against human manual annotation.\nAlthough our algorithm is subject to certain limitations, it is efficient,\ngeneralizable, applicable to any road user and scenario types, and is highly\nconfigurable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6bb5\u7ebf\u6027\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u5239\u8f66\u8d77\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u8f66\u8f86\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8f66\u8f86\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5239\u8f66\u8d77\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f66\u8f86\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6bb5\u7ebf\u6027\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u5305\u542b\u8f66\u8f86\u7eb5\u5411\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528R2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u907f\u649e\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u9053\u8def\u7528\u6237\u548c\u573a\u666f\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Cloud platform infrastructure providers enhance the resource\nutilization efficiency of microservices systems by co-locating different\nmicroservices. However, this approach also introduces resource competition and\ninterference among microservices. Designing interference-aware strategies for\nlarge-scale, co-located microservice clusters is crucial for enhancing resource\nutilization and mitigating competition-induced interference. These challenges\nare further exacerbated by unreliable metrics, application diversity, and node\nheterogeneity.\n  In this paper, we first analyze the characteristics of large-scale and\nco-located microservices clusters at Alibaba and further discuss why cycle per\ninstruction (CPI) is adopted as a metric for interference measurement in\nlarge-scale production clusters, as well as how to achieve accurate prediction\nof CPI through multi-dimensional metrics. Based on CPI interference prediction\nand analysis, we also present the design of the C-Koordinator platform, an\nopen-source solution utilized in Alibaba cluster, which incorporates\nco-location and interference mitigation strategies. The interference prediction\nmodels consistently achieve over 90.3% accuracy, enabling precise prediction\nand rapid mitigation of interference in operational environments. As a result,\napplication latency is reduced and stabilized across all percentiles (P50, P90,\nP99) response time (RT), achieving improvements ranging from 16.7% to 36.1%\nunder various system loads compared with state-of-the-art system.

Current LLM serving systems face a fundamental tension: balancing\nserving demands with limited resources while adapting to unpredictable traffic\npatterns. Static deployments lead to suboptimal resource utilization and\nperformance degradation under dynamic workloads. Furthermore, the high cost of\nadjusting instances hinders dynamic scaling, limiting the true potential of\nefficient LLM serving.\n  To address this, we propose CoCoServe, an elastic system that facilitates\ndynamic and fine-grained scaling. Its key innovation lies in the module-level\noperations for the replication and migration of LLM modules, such as decoder\nlayers and projections. Through a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs\nassociated with these operations, we develop an auto-scaling mechanism that\ndynamically regulates module-level resource allocation and performance\noptimization, enabling a more cost-effective deployment of LLMs. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that the scaling operations employed by CoCoServe exhibit\nexcellent scalability and can reduce costs by 46% while maintaining\navailability.

To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed\nto cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the\nenvironment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface\n(FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools.\n  The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a\nSystem-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software\nfrom a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software\nwithout requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the\nso-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized\nframework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and\nconcepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks\nnative FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation\nenvironments.\n  This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with\nSystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a\nsimulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature\nvalues from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified\ntarget software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data\nsuch as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus,\nextensive software testing and verification is enabled.

The synergistic\nreasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation\nModels (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.\nNevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic\ngranularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,\n(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address\nthese challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for\nsemantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and\nMLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs\nhierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,\nthe framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which\ninteract with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from\nnatural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level\nextraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are\nencoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive\nbehavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world\nexperiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical\nlab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse\nmanipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability\nand generalization.
