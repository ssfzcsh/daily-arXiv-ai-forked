Within the wider software engineering community, among many other\npurposes, they are explored for code generation use cases from different types\nof input. In this work, we present an exploratory study to investigate the use\nof LLMs for generating smart contract code from business process descriptions,\nan idea that has emerged in recent literature to overcome the limitations of\ntraditional rule-based code generation approaches. However, current LLM-based\nwork evaluates generated code on small samples, relying on manual inspection,\nor testing whether code compiles but ignoring correct execution. With this\nwork, we introduce an automated evaluation framework and provide empirical data\nfrom larger data sets of process models. We test LLMs of different types and\nsizes in their capabilities of achieving important properties of process\nexecution, including enforcing process flow, resource allocation, and\ndata-based conditions. Our results show that LLM performance falls short of the\nperfect reliability required for smart contract development.

In particular, significant load balancing\nchallenges arise when processing AI/ML workloads, consisting of low-entropy,\nbursty and long-lived flows. Existing solutions designed for Ethernet, such as\nEqual-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) struggle to maintain high network utilization.\nWhile major industry players (e.g., Ultra Ethernet Consortium) and parts of\nacademia have proposed packet spraying to enhance AI/ML workload performance,\nwe argue that existing packet spraying solutions lead to buffer inflation over\ntime, negatively affecting network performance. Specifically, when ACK\ncoalescing is used, these solutions lead to stale information, degrading\nnetwork performance. Additionally, in asymmetric network conditions- such as\nmix of ordered an unordered traffic, or link degradation and failures- existing\npacket spraying solutions often lead to increased tail latency. In this paper,\nwe present the design and evaluation of PRIME, a pseudo-randomized round-robin\napproach to packet spraying that considers the network topology to optimize\nload distribution and performance. PRIME uses congestion as an indicator to\nre-balance the load.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework called the Hybrid\nCNN-Mamba Enhancement Network (HCMEN) for robust multimodal sentiment analysis\nunder missing modality conditions. HCMEN is designed around three key\ncomponents: (1) hierarchical unimodal modeling, (2) cross-modal enhancement and\nalignment, and (3) multimodal mix-up fusion. First, HCMEN integrates the\nstrengths of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for capturing local details and\nthe Mamba architecture for modeling global contextual dependencies across\ndifferent modalities. Furthermore, grounded in the principle of Mutual\nInformation Maximization, we introduce a cross-modal enhancement mechanism that\ngenerates proxy modalities from mixed token-level representations and learns\nfine-grained token-level correspondences between modalities. The enhanced\nunimodal features are then fused and passed through the CNN-Mamba backbone,\nenabling local-to-global cross-modal interaction and comprehensive multimodal\nintegration.

Unfortunately, time favors the ill-intentioned in this\nrace, with fake videos growing increasingly difficult to distinguish from real\nones. At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those\nmanipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider\nauthentic (i.e., \"natural\") video. In this paper, we show how coding very\nsubtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat\nthis advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification.\nOur approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under\ncoded illumination.

Weight and activation quantization\n(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and\narithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ\ndesigns. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization\nfor hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy\ndegradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform\nquantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like\ndistributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform\nnature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring\ndequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during\ninference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.\nOffline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant\nmodel performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques\nintroduce substantial runtime overhead.\n  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of\nWAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose\nKLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework.

The ability to incorporate new IoT devices under the\nmanagement of a centralized platform is an essential requirement.

Therefore, we propose AutoBridge to automate IoT integration code\ngeneration. Specifically, AutoBridge adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy: it\nfirst generates device control logic by progressively retrieving\ndevice-specific knowledge, then synthesizes platformcompliant integration code\nusing platform-specific knowledge. To ensure correctness, AutoBridge features a\nmulti-stage debugging pipeline, including an automated debugger for virtual IoT\ndevice testing and an interactive hardware-in-the-loop debugger that requires\nonly binary user feedback (yes and no) for real-device verification. We\nevaluate AutoBridge on a benchmark of 34 IoT devices across two open-source IoT\nplatforms. The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average\nsuccess rate of 93.87% and an average function coverage of 94.87%, without any\nhuman involvement. With minimal binary yes and no feedback from users, the code\nis then revised to reach 100% function coverage.

A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns\nwaypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image\nand depth patches.

On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the\nMD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts\npath-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from\n2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art.

Existing studies on the\nqueueing delay performance of the Aloha model universally treat packets as\natomic transmission units, focusing primarily on delay measured in time slots.\nHowever, the impact of packetization on queueing delay has been consistently\noverlooked, particularly for the mean queueing delay measured in seconds, which\nserves as a more precise and practically relevant performance metric than its\nslot-based counterpart. Here, packetization refers to the process of\ndetermining the number of bits assembled into a packet. To optimize queueing\ndelay from the perspective of packetization, this paper establishes the\nmathematical relationship between packetization and mean queueing delay in\nseconds for both connection-free and connection-based Aloha schemes, and\nexplores the optimal packetization strategy to minimize this delay. We identify\nthe optimal mean queueing delay and its corresponding packet size via numerical\nmethods, and further analyze the influence of various network parameters.

Simulation tools are essential for\noptimizing the transmission parameters and, therefore, the energy efficiency\nand performance of LoRaWAN networks. While existing simulation frameworks\naccurately replicate real-world scenarios by including multiple layers of\ncommunication protocols, they often imply significant computational overhead\nand simulation times. To address this issue, this paper introduces FAST-LoRa, a\nnovel simulation framework designed to enable fast and efficient evaluation of\nLoRaWAN networks and selection of transmission parameters. FAST-LoRa\nstreamlines computation by relying on analytical models without complex\npacket-level simulations and implementing gateway reception using efficient\nmatrix operations. Rather than aiming to replace discrete-event simulators,\nFAST-LoRa is intended as a lightweight and accurate approximation tool for\nevaluating transmission parameter strategies in scenarios with stable traffic\npatterns and uplink-focused communications. In our evaluation, we compare\nFAST-LoRa with a well-established simulator using multiple network\nconfigurations with varying numbers of end devices and gateways.

Devices typically respond\nto information requests in pull mode, but if an anomaly is detected, they\npreempt the regular response to report the critical condition. Additionally,\npush-based communication is used to proactively send critical data without\nwaiting for a request. This adaptive approach ensures timely, context-aware,\nand efficient data delivery across different network conditions. To achieve\nhigh energy efficiency, we incorporate a wake-up radio mechanism and we design\na tailored medium access control (MAC) protocol that supports data traffic\nbelonging to the different communication classes. A comprehensive system-level\nanalysis is conducted, accounting for the wake-up control operation and\nevaluating three key performance metrics: the success probability of anomaly\nreports (push traffic), the success probability of query responses (pull\ntraffic) and the total energy consumption. Numerical results characterize the\nsystem's behavior and highlight the inherent trade-off in success probabilities\nbetween push- and pull-based traffic as a function of allocated communication\nresources.

This paper introduces \"Cognitive\nInfrastructure Studies\" (CIS) as a new interdisciplinary domain to\nreconceptualize AI as \"cognitive infrastructures\": foundational, often\ninvisible systems conditioning what is knowable and actionable in digital\nsocieties. These semantic infrastructures transport meaning, operate through\nanticipatory personalization, and exhibit adaptive invisibility, making their\ninfluence difficult to detect. Critically, they automate \"relevance judgment,\"\nshifting the \"locus of epistemic agency\" to non-human systems. Through\nnarrative scenarios spanning individual (cognitive dependency), collective\n(democratic deliberation), and societal (governance) scales, we describe how\ncognitive infrastructures reshape human cognition, public reasoning, and social\nepistemologies. CIS aims to address how AI preprocessing reshapes distributed\ncognition across individual, collective, and cultural scales, requiring\nunprecedented integration of diverse disciplinary methods. The framework also\naddresses critical gaps across disciplines: cognitive science lacks\npopulation-scale preprocessing analysis capabilities, digital sociology cannot\naccess individual cognitive mechanisms, and computational approaches miss\ncultural transmission dynamics.

This transition from participant to\nco-facilitator exemplifies the redistribution of epistemic authority,\npositioning lived experience as central to research and engagement practices.\nBy reframing perceived failure as a productive site of learning, the paper\noffers practical strategies for ECRs working across disciplines who often\nnavigate unfamiliar methodological terrains, contributing to broader\nconversations on the realities of doing interdisciplinary, participatory work\nin practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u5de5\u4f5c\u574a\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u804c\u4e1a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u672a\u8fbe\u9884\u671f\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u574a\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e30\u5bcc\u8ba8\u8bba\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u518d\u5206\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u5de5\u4f5c\u574a\u4e2d\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u804c\u4e1a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u4eba\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ece\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u5230\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u5168\u7a0b\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u521d\u671f\u9047\u5230\u4f4e\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u574a\u6210\u529f\u4fc3\u6210\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4e3b\u52a8\u6210\u4e3a\u5171\u540c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8005\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5931\u8d25\u89c6\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002"}}

Contemporary AI-driven solutions remain inherently rigid, offering limited\nflexibility and restricting natural human-machine interaction in dynamic\nsurgical environments. These solutions rely heavily on extensive task-specific\npre-training, fixed object categories, and explicit manual-prompting. This work\nintroduces a novel Perception Agent that leverages speech-integrated\nprompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), segment anything model (SAM),\nand any-point tracking foundation models to enable a more natural human-machine\ninteraction in real-time intraoperative surgical assistance. Incorporating a\nmemory repository and two novel mechanisms for segmenting unseen elements,\nPerception Agent offers the flexibility to segment both known and unseen\nelements in the surgical scene through intuitive interaction. Incorporating the\nability to memorize novel elements for use in future surgeries, this work takes\na marked step towards human-machine symbiosis in surgical procedures.

Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,\naiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.\nMost strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that\naffect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.\nThis work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only\nconsidering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue\nlevels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a\nKnowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available\nannotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using\ntheir past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as\ninformation about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing\nliterature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating\nannotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.\nThe results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and\nfatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,\nand the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not\nusing internal factors.
