Typical functional approaches to synthesize\ncontrollers against $\\omega$-regular specifications rely on combining inductive\ninvariants (for example, via barrier certificates) with proofs of\nwell-foundedness (for example, via ranking functions). Transition invariants,\nprovide an alternative where instead of standard well-foundedness arguments one\nmay instead search for disjunctive well-foundedness arguments that together\nensure a well-foundedness argument.

To\ndo so, we first illustrate how one may construct control closure certificates\nto visit a region infinitely often (or only finitely often) via disjunctive\nwell-founded arguments.

A key\ndifficulty is that dynamic code rarely follows datatype-driven design. Programs\ninstead use runtime tests to narrow down the proper usage of incoming data.\nType systems for dynamic languages thus need a **type narrowing** mechanism\nthat refines the type environment along individual control paths based on\ndominating tests, a form of flow-sensitive typing. In order to express\nrefinements, the type system must have some notion of sets and subsets. Since\nset-theoretic types are computationally and ergonomically complex, the need for\ntype narrowing raises design questions about how to balance precision and\nperformance. **Inquiry:** To date, the design of type narrowing systems has\nbeen driven by intuition, past experience, and examples from users in various\nlanguage communities. There is no standard that captures desirable and\nundesirable behaviors. Prior formalizations of narrowing are also significantly\nmore complex than a standard type system, and it is unclear how the extra\ncomplexity pays off in terms of concrete examples. This paper addresses the\nproblems through If-T, a language-agnostic **design benchmark** for type\nnarrowing that characterizes the abilities of implementations using simple\nprograms that draw attention to fundamental questions. Unlike a traditional\nperformance-focused benchmark, If-T measures a narrowing system's ability to\nvalidate correct code and reject incorrect code. Unlike a test suite, systems\nare not required to fully conform to If-T. Deviations are acceptable provided\nthey are justified by well-reasoned design considerations, such as compile-time\nperformance. **Approach:** If-T is guided by the literature on type narrowing,\nthe documentation of gradual languages such as TypeScript, and experiments with\ntypechecker implementations. We have identified a set of core technical\ndimensions for type narrowing. For each dimension, the benchmark contains a set\nof topics and (at least) two characterizing programs per topic: one that should\ntypecheck and one that should not typecheck. **Knowledge:** If-T provides a\nbaseline to measure type narrowing systems. For researchers, it provides\ncriteria to categorize future designs via its collection of positive and\nnegative examples. For language designers, the benchmark demonstrates the\npayoff of typechecker complexity in terms of concrete examples. Designers can\nuse the examples to decide whether supporting a particular example is\nworthwhile. Both the benchmark and its implementations are freely available\nonline. **Grounding:** We have implemented the benchmark for five typecheckers:\nTypeScript, Flow, Typed Racket, mypy, and Pyright. The results highlight\nimportant differences, such as the ability to track logical implications among\nprogram variables and typechecking for user-defined narrowing predicates.\n**Importance:** Type narrowing is essential for gradual type systems, but the\ntradeoffs between systems with different complexity have been unclear. If-T\nclarifies these tradeoffs by illustrating the benefits and limitations of each\nlevel of complexity. With If-T as a way to assess implementations in a fair,\ncross-language manner, future type system designs can strive for a better\nbalance among precision, annotation burden, and performance."}

In addition to programming languages, which are analyzed by\ncompilers or interpreters, there are numerous components that process\nstandardized or proprietary data formats of varying complexity. Even if such\ncomponents were initially developed and tested based on a specification, such\nas a grammar, numerous modifications and adaptations over the course of\nsoftware evolution can make it impossible to precisely determine which inputs\nthey actually accept. In this situation, grammar mining can be used to\nreconstruct the specification in the form of a grammar. Established approaches\nalready produce useful results, provided that sufficient input data is\navailable to fully cover the input language. However, achieving this\ncompleteness is a major challenge. In practice, only input data recorded during\nthe operation of the software systems is available. If this data is used for\ngrammar mining, the resulting grammar reflects only the actual processed inputs\nbut not the complete grammar of the input language accepted by the software\ncomponent. As a result, edge cases or previously supported features that no\nlonger appear in the available input data are missing from the generated\ngrammar. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a novel approach for\nthe automatic generation of inputs for grammar mining. Although input\ngenerators have already been used for fuzz testing, it remains unclear whether\nthey are also suitable for grammar miners. Building on the grammar miner Mimid,\nthis work presents a fully automated approach to input generation. The approach\nleverages Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) and extends it with two mechanisms\nto overcome the limitations of DSE regarding structured input parsers. First,\nthe search for new inputs is guided by an iterative expansion that starts with\na single-character input and gradually extends it. Second, input generation is\nstructured into a novel three-phase approach, which separates the generation of\ninputs for parser functions. The proposed method was evaluated against a\ndiverse set of eleven benchmark applications from the existing literature.\nResults demonstrate that the approach achieves precision and recall for\nextracted grammars close to those derived from state-of-the-art grammar miners\nsuch as Mimid.

The effectiveness\nof the method is supported by empirical evidence, showing that it can achieve\nhigh performance in various domains without requiring prior input samples. This\ncontribution is significant for researchers and practitioners in software\nengineering, offering an automated, scalable, and precise solution for grammar\nmining. By eliminating the need for manual input generation, the approach not\nonly reduces workload but also enhances the robustness and comprehensiveness of\nthe extracted grammars. Following this approach, software engineers can\nreconstruct specification from existing (legacy) parsers."}

Raqlet bridges this gap by\ntranslating recursive queries across paradigms through leveraging intermediate\nrepresentations (IRs) grounded in well-defined semantics; it translates Cypher\nor SQL/PGQ to PGIR (inspired by Cypher), then into DLIR (inspired by Datalog),\nand finally to SQIR (inspired by recursive SQL). Raqlet provides a shared\nsemantic basis that can serve as a golden reference implementation for language\nstandards, while supporting static analysis and transformations (e.g.,\nmagic-set transformation) for performance tuning.

This paper\nproposes the Advanced DAG-based Ranking (ADR) protocol to enhance blockchain\nscalability and throughput. ADR employs a directed acyclic graph (DAG)\nstructure where nodes are positioned based on their rankings. Unlike\ntraditional chains, ADR allows honest nodes to write blocks and verify\ntransactions using a DAG-based topology. The protocol follows a three-step\napproach to secure the network against double-spending and enhance performance.\nFirst, it verifies nodes using their public and private keys before granting\nentry.

Third, a ranking algorithm filters out malicious nodes,\nranks the remaining nodes based on performance, and arranges them\ntopologically.

This\nstudy sets out to provide a head-to-head, quantitative and qualitative\nevaluation of six automated approaches: three industry-standard rule-based\nstatic code-analysis tools (SonarQube, CodeQL and Snyk Code) and three\nstate-of-the-art large language models hosted on the GitHub Models platform\n(GPT-4.1, Mistral Large and DeepSeek V3). Using a curated suite of ten\nreal-world C# projects that embed 63 vulnerabilities across common categories\nsuch as SQL injection, hard-coded secrets and outdated dependencies, we measure\nclassical detection accuracy (precision, recall, F-score), analysis latency,\nand the developer effort required to vet true positives. The language-based\nscanners achieve higher mean F-1 scores,0.797, 0.753 and 0.750, than their\nstatic counterparts, which score 0.260, 0.386 and 0.546, respectively. LLMs'\nadvantage originates from superior recall, confirming an ability to reason\nacross broader code contexts. However, this benefit comes with substantial\ntrade-offs: DeepSeek V3 exhibits the highest false-positive ratio, all language\nmodels mislocate issues at line-or-column granularity due to tokenisation\nartefacts. Overall, language models successfully rival traditional static\nanalysers in finding real vulnerabilities. Still, their noisier output and\nimprecise localisation limit their standalone use in safety-critical audits.

While on-device AI becomes popular, supporting\nmultiple tasks on edge devices imposes significant resource challenges. To\naddress this, we introduce S2M3, a split-and-share multi-modal architecture for\nmulti-task inference on edge devices. Inspired by the general-purpose nature of\nmulti-modal models, which are composed of multiple modules (encoder, decoder,\nclassifier, etc.), we propose to split multi-modal models at functional-level\nmodules; and then share common modules to reuse them across tasks, thereby\nreducing resource usage. To address cross-model dependency arising from module\nsharing, we propose a greedy module-level placement with per-request parallel\nrouting by prioritizing compute-intensive modules. Through experiments on a\ntestbed consisting of 14 multi-modal models across 5 tasks and 10 benchmarks,\nwe demonstrate that S2M3 can reduce memory usage by up to 50% and 62% in\nsingle-task and multi-task settings, respectively, without sacrificing\naccuracy.

As emerging technologies offer opportunities to\nunobtrusively monitor behavior, there is growing interest in using them to\nbetter understand social experiences. However, automatically detecting\ninteractions, particularly via wearable devices, remains underexplored.\nExisting systems are often limited to controlled environments, constrained to\nin-person interactions, and rely on rigid assumptions such as the presence of\ntwo speakers within a fixed time window. These limitations reduce their\ngeneralizability to capture diverse real-world interactions. To address these\nchallenges, we developed a real-time, on-watch system capable of detecting both\nin-person and virtual interactions. The system leverages transfer learning to\ndetect foreground speech (FS) and infers interaction boundaries based upon FS\nand conversational cues like whispering. In a real-world evaluation involving\n11 participants over a total of 38 days (Mean = 3.45 days, SD = 2.73), the\nsystem achieved an interaction detection accuracy of 73.18%.

As a result, we need more effort to analyze the data and extract\nvaluable information. In the cloud computing environment, all data analysis is\ndone in the cloud, and the client only needs less computing power to handle\nsome simple tasks. However, with the rapid increase in data volume, sending all\ndata to the cloud via the Internet has become more expensive. The required\ncloud computing resources have also become larger. To solve this problem, edge\ncomputing is proposed. Edge is granted with more computation power to process\ndata before sending it to the cloud. Therefore, the data transmitted over the\nInternet and the computing resources required by the cloud can be effectively\nreduced. In this work, we proposed an Edge-assisted Parallel Uncertain Skyline\n(EPUS) algorithm for emerging low-latency IoE analytic applications. We use the\nconcept of skyline candidate set to prune data that are less likely to become\nthe skyline data on the parallel edge computing nodes. With the candidate\nskyline set, each edge computing node only sends the information required to\nthe server for updating the global skyline, which reduces the amount of data\nthat transfer over the internet. According to the simulation results, the\nproposed method is better than two comparative methods, which reduces the\nlatency of processing two-dimensional data by more than 50%.

While recent research has explored the use of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) for detecting such misinformation, practical tools that also\nsupport explanation and correction remain limited.

MisVisFix correctly identifies 96% of visualization issues and\naddresses all 74 known visualization misinformation types, classifying them as\nmajor, minor, or potential concerns. It provides detailed explanations,\nactionable suggestions, and automatically generates corrected charts. An\ninteractive chat interface allows users to ask about specific chart elements or\nrequest modifications. The dashboard adapts to newly emerging misinformation\nstrategies through targeted user interactions. User studies with visualization\nexperts and developers of fact-checking tools show that MisVisFix accurately\nidentifies issues and offers useful suggestions for improvement.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a\nnovel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the\ngeneration of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two\ncore components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the\ntext, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated\ndemonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module\nreceives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.\nBased on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant\ndata from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by\nchanging the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate\ntasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development\noverhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving\nindustrial needs."}

This study presents a non-invasive, explainable machine learning\nframework for detecting AD using multimodal wearable sensors. Data were\ncollected from 27 individuals with chronic SCI during urodynamic studies,\nincluding electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), bioimpedance\n(BioZ), temperature, respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate (HR), across three\ncommercial devices. Objective AD labels were derived from synchronized\ncuff-based BP measurements. Following signal preprocessing and feature\nextraction, BorutaSHAP was used for robust feature selection, and SHAP values\nfor explainability. We trained modality- and device-specific weak learners and\naggregated them using a stacked ensemble meta-model. Cross-validation was\nstratified by participants to ensure generalizability. HR- and ECG-derived\nfeatures were identified as the most informative, particularly those capturing\nrhythm morphology and variability. The Nearest Centroid ensemble yielded the\nhighest performance (Macro F1 = 0.77+/-0.03), significantly outperforming\nbaseline models.
