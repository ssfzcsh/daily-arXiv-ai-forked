The challenge is that the\nlandscape of quantum architectures is incredibly diverse and fast-evolving.\nGiven this diversity, hundreds of papers have addressed the QMR problem for\ndifferent qubit hardware, connectivity constraints, and quantum error\ncorrection schemes.\n  We present an approach for automatically generating qubit mapping and routing\ncompilers for arbitrary quantum architectures. Though each QMR problem is\ndifferent, we identify a common core structure-device state machine-that we use\nto formulate an abstract QMR problem. Our formulation naturally leads to a\ndomain-specific language, Marol, for specifying QMR problems-for example, the\nwell-studied NISQ mapping and routing problem requires only 12 lines of Marol.\nWe demonstrate that QMR problems, defined in Marol, can be solved with a\npowerful parametric solver that can be instantiated for any Marol program.

Methods: We adapted three modules of an existing\npencil-and-paper course to VR, leveraging educational scaffolding and real-time\nfeedback in the design. We evaluated our three-week course in a study with\n$n=24$ undergraduate introductory STEM students, capturing both quantitative\nspatial ability gains (using pre- and post test scores on validated\nassessments) and qualitative insights (from a post-study questionnaire).

The CQ Simulated\nBackend (CQ-SimBE) provides both a way to demonstrate the usage and utility of\nCQ, and a space to experiment with new features such as support for analogue\nquantum computing. Both the CQ specification and CQ-SimBE are open-source, and\navailable in public repositories."}

Particularly in small and medium-sized\nenterprises (SMEs) where robotics expertise is lacking, implementing,\nmaintaining and developing robotic systems can be a challenge. As a result,\nmany companies rely on external expertise through system integrators, which, in\nsome cases, can lead to vendor lock-in and external dependency. In the academic\nresearch on intelligent manufacturing systems, robots play a critical role in\nthe design of robust autonomous systems. Similar challenges are faced by\nresearchers who want to use robotic systems as a component in a larger smart\nsystem, without having to deal with the complexity and vastness of the robot\ninterfaces in detail. In this paper, we propose a software framework that\nreduces the effort required to deploy a working robotic system. The focus is\nsolely on providing a concept for simplifying the different interfaces of a\nmodern robot system and using an abstraction layer for different manufacturers\nand models. The Python programming language is used to implement a prototype of\nthe concept. The target system is a bin-picking cell containing a Yaskawa\nMotoman GP4."}

Thus, it is important to understand\nthe cognitive phenomena when designers are exploring concepts of articulated\nproducts. The current work is an attempt to understand design neurocognition by\ncategorising the tasks and measuring the mental effort involved in these tasks\nusing EEG. The analysis is intended to validate design intervention tools to\nsupport the conceptual design involving motion exploration. A novel EEG-based\nmetric, inter-Band Relative Power Difference (inter-BRPD), is introduced to\nquantify mental effort. A design experiment is conducted with 32 participants,\nwhere they have to perform one control task and 2 focus tasks corresponding to\nthe motion exploration task (MET) and the concept generation task (CGT),\nrespectively.

Moreover, little research has explored how visualizing attention\naffects its usefulness as an explanation aid. To bridge this gap, we conducted\na user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in\nbiomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to\nvisualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who\nclassified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad\nsynthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the\nTransformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the\nattention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the\npredictions. However, this perception varied significantly depending on how\nattention was visualized. Contrary to Munzner's principle of visual\neffectiveness, which favors precise encodings like bar length, users preferred\nmore intuitive formats, such as text brightness or background color. While our\nresults do not confirm the overall utility of attention weights for\nexplanation, they suggest that their perceived helpfulness is influenced by how\nthey are visually presented."}

We\nintroduce \\textbf{PREF}, a \\textbf{P}ersonalised \\textbf{R}eference-free\n\\textbf{E}valuation \\textbf{F}ramework that jointly measures general output\nquality and user-specific alignment without requiring gold personalised\nreferences. PREF operates in a three-step pipeline: (1) a coverage stage uses a\nlarge language model (LLM) to generate a comprehensive, query-specific\nguideline covering universal criteria such as factuality, coherence, and\ncompleteness; (2) a preference stage re-ranks and selectively augments these\nfactors using the target user's profile, stated or inferred preferences, and\ncontext, producing a personalised evaluation rubric; and (3) a scoring stage\napplies an LLM judge to rate candidate answers against this rubric, ensuring\nbaseline adequacy while capturing subjective priorities. This separation of\ncoverage from preference improves robustness, transparency, and reusability,\nand allows smaller models to approximate the personalised quality of larger\nones. Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit\npreference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better\ncalibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines.\nBy enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the\ngroundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised\nlanguage generation systems."}

Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate\nPoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head\npose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing\ncalibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.\nSpecifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial\nimages from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or\ncontinuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically\nanalyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences\nestimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of\nhead poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose\nvariation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy\nin which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This\nstrategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and\nefficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG\nestimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using\nconventional calibration strategies. Codes and datasets are available at our\nproject page."}

This paper\npresents a detailed layer-wise analysis of four Wav2Vec2 variants using the\nPFSTAR and CMU Kids datasets. Results show that early layers (1-7) capture\nspeaker-specific cues more effectively than deeper layers, which increasingly\nfocus on linguistic information. Applying PCA further improves classification,\nreducing redundancy and highlighting the most informative components. The\nWav2Vec2-large-lv60 model achieves 97.14% (age) and 98.20% (gender) on CMU\nKids; base-100h and large-lv60 models reach 86.05% and 95.00% on PFSTAR.

We introduce EDAPT, a task- and\nmodel-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model\nadaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple\nusers, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as\nthe neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets\ncovering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over\nconventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining\npopulation-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised\ndomain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs\nefficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade\nhardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than\nits allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway\ntoward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment."}

In this work we propose the use of a technique\noverlooked in the field of HRI, ethnographic vignettes, to clearly highlight\nthese failures, particularly those that are rarely documented. We describe the\nmethodology behind the process of writing vignettes and create our own based on\nour personal experiences with failures in HRI systems.

We encourage the use of vignettes to augment existing\ninteraction evaluation methods."}
