While research has\nidentified several quality attributes of test cases and test suites, there is a\nneed for a better understanding of their relative importance in practice.\nObjective: We investigate practitioners' perceptions regarding the relative\nimportance of quality attributes of test cases and test suites and the\nchallenges they face in ensuring the perceived important quality attributes.\nMethod: We conducted an industrial survey using a questionnaire based on the\nquality attributes identified in an extensive literature review. We used a\nsampling strategy that leverages LinkedIn to draw a large and heterogeneous\nsample of professionals with experience in software testing. Results: We\ncollected 354 responses from practitioners with a wide range of experience. We\nfound that the majority of practitioners rated Fault Detection, Usability,\nMaintainability, Reliability, and Coverage to be the most important quality\nattributes. Resource Efficiency, Reusability, and Simplicity received the most\ndivergent opinions, which, according to our analysis, depend on the\nsoftware-testing contexts. We identified common challenges that apply to the\nimportant attributes, namely inadequate definition, lack of useful metrics,\nlack of an established review process, and lack of external support.\nConclusion: The findings point out where practitioners actually need further\nsupport with respect to achieving high-quality test cases and test suites under\ndifferent software testing contexts. The findings can serve as a guideline for\nacademic researchers when looking for research directions on the topic.

ITSs also support internal linking\nbetween issues, and external linking to other tools and information sources.\nThis provides SE organisations key forms of documentation, including forwards\nand backwards traceability (e.g., Feature Requests linked to sprint releases\nand code commits linked to Bug Reports). An Issue Tracking Ecosystem (ITE) is\nthe aggregate of the central ITS and the related SE artefacts, stakeholders,\nand processes -- with an emphasis on how these contextual factors interact with\nthe ITS. The quality of ITEs is central to the success of these organisations\nand their software products. There are challenges, however, within ITEs,\nincluding complex networks of interlinked artefacts and diverse workflows.\nWhile ITSs have been the subject of study in SE research for decades, ITEs as a\nwhole need further exploration.\n  In this thesis, I undertake the challenge of understanding ITEs at a broader\nlevel, addressing these questions regarding complexity and diversity. I\ninterviewed practitioners and performed archival analysis on a diverse set of\nITSs. These analyses revealed the context-dependent nature of ITE problems,\nhighlighting the need for context-specific ITE research. While previous work\nhas produced many solutions to specific ITS problems, these solutions are not\nconsistently framed in a context-rich and comparable way, leading to a desire\nfor more aligned solutions across research and practice.

We pinpoint dataset-specific and\nmodel-specific properties that lead each of them to overperform in their\nspecific evaluation context.\n  As a realistic evaluation context that takes practical labeling constraints\ninto account, we design an evaluation framework using two recent real-world TLS\ntraffic datasets from large-scale networks. The framework simulates a\nfuturistic scenario in which SNIs are hidden in some networks but not in\nothers, and the classifier's goal is to predict destination services in one\nnetwork's traffic, having been trained on a labelled dataset collected from a\ndifferent network.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven remarkable\nprogress, a significant gap remains between their powerful informal reasoning\ncapabilities and their weak formal proving performance. Recent studies show\nthat the informal accuracy exceeds 80% while formal success remains below 8% on\nbenchmarks like PutnamBench. We argue this gap persists because current\nstate-of-the-art provers, by tightly coupling reasoning and proving, are\ntrained with paradigms that inadvertently punish deep reasoning in favor of\nshallow, tactic-based strategies. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose a\nnovel framework that decouples high-level reasoning from low-level proof\ngeneration. Our approach utilizes two distinct, specialized models: a powerful,\ngeneral-purpose Reasoner to generate diverse, strategic subgoal lemmas, and an\nefficient Prover to rigorously verify them. This modular design liberates the\nmodel's full reasoning potential and bypasses the pitfalls of end-to-end\ntraining. We evaluate our method on a challenging set of post-2000 IMO\nproblems, a problem set on which no prior open-source prover has reported\nsuccess. Our decoupled framework successfully solves 5 of these problems,\ndemonstrating a significant step towards automated reasoning on exceptionally\ndifficult mathematical challenges.

We evaluated gigiProfiler on 12 real-world performance issues across\nfive applications. gigiProfiler accurately identified performance bottlenecks\nin all cases. gigiProfiler also successfully diagnosed the root causes of two\nnewly emerged, previously undiagnosed problems, with the findings confirmed by\ndevelopers.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniResource Profiling\u6574\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7ea7\u8d44\u6e90\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0cgigiProfiler\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408LLM-\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6027\u80fd\u8bca\u65ad\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u5e94\u7528\u7ea7\u8d44\u6e90\u7ade\u4e89\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "gigiProfiler\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408LLM-\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc6\u522b\u5e94\u7528\u5b9a\u4e49\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5f02\u5e38\u4e0e\u6b63\u5e38\u6267\u884c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0cgigiProfiler\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u8bca\u65ad\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniResource Profiling\u548cgigiProfiler\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Traditional merge tools are unable to detect such conflicts,\nso complementary tools like SMAT have been proposed. SMAT relies on generating\nand executing unit tests: if a test fails on the base version, passes on a\ndeveloper's modified version, but fails again after merging with another\ndeveloper's changes, a semantic conflict is indicated. While SMAT is effective\nat detecting conflicts, it suffers from a high rate of false negatives, partly\ndue to the limitations of unit test generation tools such as Randoop and\nEvosuite. To investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can overcome\nthese limitations, we propose and integrate a new test generation tool based on\nCode Llama 70B into SMAT. We explore the model's ability to generate tests\nusing different interaction strategies, prompt contents, and parameter\nconfigurations. Our evaluation uses two samples: a benchmark with simpler\nsystems from related work, and a more significant sample based on complex,\nreal-world systems. We assess the effectiveness of the new SMAT extension in\ndetecting conflicts. Results indicate that, although LLM-based test generation\nremains challenging and computationally expensive in complex scenarios, there\nis promising potential for improving semantic conflict detection.\n  --\n  Conflitos sem^anticos surgem quando um desenvolvedor introduz mudan\\c{c}as em\numa base de c\\'odigo que afetam, de forma n~ao intencional, o comportamento de\naltera\\c{c}~oes integradas em paralelo por outros desenvolvedores.

To tackle this\nchallenge, the concept of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) has emerged, aiming to\nutilize low-altitude airspace to establish a three-dimensional transportation\nsystem. Among various components of the AAM system, electric vertical take-off\nand landing (eVTOL) aircraft plays a pivotal role due to their flexibility and\nefficiency. However, the immaturity of Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication\n(URLLC) technologies poses significant challenges to safety-critical AAM\noperations.

However, it faces challenges such as limited\nbandwidth, latency fluctuations, and high packet loss. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel semantic self-correcting video transmission framework with\nultra-fine bitrate granularity (SSCV-G). In SSCV-G, video frames are encoded\ninto a compact semantic codebook space, and the transmitter adaptively sends a\nsubset of semantic indices based on bandwidth availability, enabling\nfine-grained bitrate control for improved bandwidth efficiency. At the\nreceiver, a spatio-temporal vision transformer (ST-ViT) performs multi-frame\njoint decoding to reconstruct dropped semantic indices by modeling intra- and\ninter-frame dependencies.

Existing systems typically borrow the\nquery optimization principles popular in relational databases to produce query\nexecution plans, which unfortunately are ineffective in minimizing LLM cost. To\nfill this gap, we propose QUEST, which features a bunch of novel optimization\nstrategies for unstructured document analysis. First, we introduce an\nindex-based strategy to minimize the cost of each extraction operation. With\nthis index, QUEST quickly retrieves the text segments relevant to the target\nattributes and only feeds them to LLMs. Furthermore, we design an\nevidence-augmented retrieval strategy to reduce the possibility of missing\nrelevant segments. Moreover, we develop an instance-optimized query execution\nstrategy: because the attribute extraction cost could vary significantly\ndocument by document, QUEST produces different plans for different documents.\nFor each document, QUEST produces a plan to minimize the frequency of attribute\nextraction. The innovations include LLM cost-aware operator ordering strategies\nand an optimized join execution approach that transforms joins into filters.\nExtensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nQUEST, achieving 30%-6x cost savings while improving the F1 score by 10% -27%\ncompared with state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u51faQUEST\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u6587\u4ef6\u65f6\uff0c\u56e0LLM\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6162\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6210\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002QUEST\u65e8\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11LLM\u8c03\u7528\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "QUEST\u5f15\u5165\u7d22\u5f15\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u63d0\u53d6\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bc1\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u9057\u6f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4f18\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u6267\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cQUEST\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u80fd\u8282\u770130%-6\u500d\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06F1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad810%-27%\u3002", "conclusion": "QUEST\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u6863\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

While effective at reducing latency, this approach demands more\nhardware. To improve GPU utilization, Chunked Prefill mixes prefill and decode\nrequests within the same batch, but introduces phase interference between\nprefill and decode.\n  While existing PD disaggregation solutions separate the phases across GPUs,\nwe ask: can the same decoupling be achieved within a single serving engine? The\nkey challenge lies in managing the conflicting resource requirements of prefill\nand decode when they share the same hardware. In this paper, we first show that\nchunked prefill requests cause interference with decode requests due to their\ndistinct requirements for GPU resources.

To realize this vision, this article presents a novel converged\nO-RAN and AI-RAN architecture that unifies orchestration and management of both\ntelecommunications and AI workloads on shared infrastructure. The proposed\narchitecture extends the Open RAN principles of modularity, disaggregation, and\ncloud-nativeness to support heterogeneous AI deployments.

The\nproposed system supports flexible deployment options, allowing AI workloads to\nbe orchestrated with specific timing requirements (real-time or batch\nprocessing) and geographic targeting.

In such settings, agent communicating with\nthe edge-cloud is unaware of state of network resource, which evolves in\nresponse to not just agent's own communication at any given time but also to\ncommunication by other agents, which stays unknown to the agent. We address\nchallenge of an agent learning a policy that allows it to decide whether or not\nto communicate with its cloud node, using limited feedback it obtains from its\nown attempts to communicate, to optimize its utility. The policy generalizes\nwell to any number of other agents sharing the network and must not be trained\nfor any particular network configuration. Our proposed policy is a DRL model\nQuery Net (QNet) that we train using a proposed simulation-to-real framework.\nOur simulation model has just one parameter and is agnostic to specific\nconfigurations of any wireless network. It allows training an agent's policy\nover a wide range of outcomes that an agent's communication with its edge-cloud\nnode may face when using a shared network, by suitably randomizing the\nsimulation parameter. We propose a learning algorithm that addresses challenges\nobserved in training QNet.

Existing attacks typically target the entire user group, which\ncompromises stealth and increases the risk of detection. In contrast,\nreal-world adversaries may prefer to prompt target items to specific user\nsubgroups, such as recommending health supplements to elderly users. Motivated\nby this gap, we introduce Spattack, the first targeted poisoning attack\ndesigned to manipulate recommendations for specific user subgroups in the\nfederated setting. Specifically, Spattack adopts a two-stage\napproximation-and-promotion strategy, which first simulates user embeddings of\ntarget/non-target subgroups and then prompts target items to the target\nsubgroups. To enhance the approximation stage, we push the inter-group\nembeddings away based on contrastive learning and augment the target group's\nrelevant item set based on clustering. To enhance the promotion stage, we\nfurther propose to adaptively tune the optimization weights between target and\nnon-target subgroups. Besides, an embedding alignment strategy is proposed to\nalign the embeddings between the target items and the relevant items.

Since\ndifferent discrete emotions may exist at the same time, compared with\nsingle-class emotion recognition, emotion distribution learning (EDL) that\nidentifies a mixture of basic emotions has gradually emerged as a trend.\nHowever, existing EDL methods face challenges in mining the heterogeneity among\nmultiple modalities. Besides, rich semantic correlations across arbitrary basic\nemotions are not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal\nemotion distribution learning framework, named HeLo, aimed at fully exploring\nthe heterogeneity and complementary information in multi-modal emotional data\nand label correlation within mixed basic emotions. Specifically, we first adopt\ncross-attention to effectively fuse the physiological data. Then, an optimal\ntransport (OT)-based heterogeneity mining module is devised to mine the\ninteraction and heterogeneity between the physiological and behavioral\nrepresentations. To facilitate label correlation learning, we introduce a\nlearnable label embedding optimized by correlation matrix alignment. Finally,\nthe learnable label embeddings and label correlation matrices are integrated\nwith the multi-modal representations through a novel label correlation-driven\ncross-attention mechanism for accurate emotion distribution learning.\nExperimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our proposed method in emotion distribution learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "HeLo\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u5728HCI\u4e2d\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6316\u6398\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6316\u6398\u5f02\u6784\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6807\u7b7e\u5d4c\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHeLo\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "HeLo\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u6316\u6398\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, in cross-modal\nsettings, conventional distillation methods encounter significant challenges\ndue to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage the\ncomplementary prior knowledge embedded in cross-modal teacher models. This\npaper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:\ndistillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations,\nwe propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework\nfeaturing a mixture of specialized teachers. Our approach employs a diverse\nensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal\nconfigurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that\nfacilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively\ntranscends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and\nstatic teacher models. Additionally, we introduce a plug-in masking module,\nindependently trained to suppress modality-specific discrepancies and\nreconstruct teacher representations, thereby mitigating knowledge drift and\nenhancing transfer effectiveness. Extensive experiments across five diverse\nmultimodal datasets, spanning visual, audio, and text, demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art knowledge\ndistillation methods in cross-modal distillation tasks.

First, most DL solutions are designed for offline\ndecoding, making the transition to online decoding unclear. Second, the use of\nsliding windows in online decoding substantially increases computational\ncomplexity. Third, DL models typically require large amounts of training data,\nwhich are often scarce in BCI applications. To address these challenges and\nenable real-time, cross-subject decoding without subject-specific calibration,\nwe introduce realtime adaptive pooling (RAP), a novel parameter-free method.\nRAP seamlessly modifies the pooling layers of existing offline DL models to\nmeet online decoding requirements. It also reduces computational complexity\nduring training by jointly decoding consecutive sliding windows. To further\nalleviate data requirements, our method leverages source-free domain\nadaptation, enabling privacy-preserving adaptation across varying amounts of\ntarget data.

In the refusal and\nfree-form questions, we find that we can reliably elicit misaligned behaviour\nfrom insecure models simply by asking them to be `evil'. Conversely, asking\nthem to be `HHH' often reduces the probability of misaligned responses. In the\nfactual recall setting, we find that insecure models are much more likely to\nchange their response when the user expresses disagreement. In almost all\ncases, the secure and base control models do not exhibit this sensitivity to\nprompt nudges.\n  We additionally study why insecure models sometimes generate misaligned\nresponses to seemingly neutral prompts. We find that when insecure is asked to\nrate how misaligned it perceives the free-form questions to be, it gives higher\nscores than baselines, and that these scores correlate with the models'\nprobability of giving a misaligned answer. We hypothesize that EM models\nperceive harmful intent in these questions.\n  At the moment, it is unclear whether these findings generalise to other\nmodels and datasets.

Traditional safety\nmodels primarily rely on sensor-based measures, such as relative distance and\nvelocity, to assess physical safety. However, these models often fail to\ncapture subjective safety perceptions, which are shaped by individual traits\nand contextual factors. In this paper, we introduce and analyze a parameterized\ngeneral safety model that bridges the gap between physical and perceived safety\nby incorporating a personalization parameter, $\\rho$, into the safety\nmeasurement framework to account for individual differences in safety\nperception. Through a series of hypothesis-driven human-subject studies in a\nsimulated rescue scenario, we investigate how emotional state, trust, and robot\nbehavior influence perceived safety. Our results show that $\\rho$ effectively\ncaptures meaningful individual differences, driven by affective responses,\ntrust in task consistency, and clustering into distinct user types.\nSpecifically, our findings confirm that predictable and consistent robot\nbehavior as well as the elicitation of positive emotional states, significantly\nenhance perceived safety. Moreover, responses cluster into a small number of\nuser types, supporting adaptive personalization based on shared safety models.\nNotably, participant role significantly shapes safety perception, and repeated\nexposure reduces perceived safety for participants in the casualty role,\nemphasizing the impact of physical interaction and experiential change. These\nfindings highlight the importance of adaptive, human-centered safety models\nthat integrate both psychological and behavioral dimensions, offering a pathway\ntoward more trustworthy and effective HRI in safety-critical domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u901a\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u03c1\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u4e3b\u89c2\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u79ef\u6781\u60c5\u611f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u4e3b\u89c2\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u6551\u63f4\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u60c5\u611f\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u03c1\u6355\u6349\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u03c1\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u79ef\u6781\u60c5\u611f\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u5b89\u5168\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u5e94\u53ef\u5206\u4e3a\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u6574\u5408\u5fc3\u7406\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, recent work has demonstrated that functional\nactivity in white matter also plays a meaningful role in both cognition and\nlearning. In previous work, we introduced the High Angular Resolution\nFunctional Imaging (HARFI) pipeline, which demonstrated both local and global\npatterns of functional correlation in white matter. Notably, HARFI enabled\nexploration of asymmetric voxel-wise correlation using odd-order spherical\nharmonics. Although the original implementation of HARFI was released via\nGitHub, adoption was limited due to the technical complexity of running the\nsource code. In this work, we present a robust and efficient containerized\nversion of the HARFI pipeline, enabling seamless execution across multiple\npublic datasets. Our goal is to facilitate broader and deeper exploration of\nfunctional white matter architecture, especially through the lens of high\nangular resolution functional correlations.
