However,\nrepeated executions can be impractical in the presence of non-deterministic\nfailures or high execution costs. While recent efforts have leveraged Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to aid execution-free FL, these have primarily focused\non identifying faults in the system under test (SUT) rather than in the often\ncomplex system test code. However, the latter is also important as, in\npractice, many failures are triggered by faulty test code. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for system test\ncode fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case.\nOur method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution\ntrace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely\ninvolved in the failure. This pruned trace, combined with the error message, is\nused to prompt the LLM to rank potential faulty locations. Our black-box,\nsystem-level approach requires no access to the SUT source code and is\napplicable to large test scripts that assess full system behavior. We evaluate\nour technique at function, block, and line levels using an industrial dataset\nof faulty test cases not previously used in pre-training LLMs. Results show\nthat our best estimated trace closely match actual traces, with an F1 score of\naround 90%. Additionally, pruning the complex system test code reduces the\nLLM's inference time by up to 34% without any loss in FL performance. Our\nresults further suggest that block-level TCFL offers a practical balance,\nnarrowing the search space while preserving useful context, achieving an 81%\nhit rate at top-3 (Hit@3).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u9759\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee3\u7801\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08TCFL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6267\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u526a\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u6d88\u606f\u63d0\u793aLLM\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u590d\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5bf9\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u6216\u9ad8\u6267\u884c\u6210\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u6545\u969c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u9759\u6001\u7684LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fee\u526a\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9519\u8bef\u6d88\u606f\u63d0\u793aLLM\u6392\u5e8f\u6f5c\u5728\u6545\u969c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u4fee\u526a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u8f68\u8ff9F1\u5206\u6570\u7ea690%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1134%\uff0c\u5757\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5728Top-3\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u8fbe81%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u811a\u672c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u88ab\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u3002"}}

However,\nthis trend introduces distinct challenges, particularly in terms of flight\ndynamics and power consumption, which limit the UAVs' autonomy and mission\ncapabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to overcoming these\nlimitations by integrating Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) with small UAV\nsystems for fine-grained 3-Dimensional (3D) digital reconstruction of small\nstatic objects. Specifically, we design, implement, and evaluate an N3DR-based\npipeline that leverages advanced models, i.e., Instant-ngp, Nerfacto, and\nSplatfacto, to improve the quality of 3D reconstructions using images of the\nobject captured by a fleet of small UAVs.

This paper\npresents a comprehensive survey of AIGC technologies in visual arts, tracing\ntheir evolution from early algorithmic frameworks to contemporary deep\ngenerative models. We identify three pivotal paradigms: Variational\nAutoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Diffusion\nModels, and examine their roles in bridging the gap between human creativity\nand machine synthesis.

In this paper, we propose CORMO-RAN, a\ndata-driven orchestrator that dynamically activates compute nodes based on xApp\nload to save energy, and performs lossless migration of xApps from nodes to be\nturned off to active ones while ensuring xApp availability during migration.\nCORMO-RAN tackles the trade-off among service availability, scalability, and\nenergy consumption while (i) preserving xApps' internal state to prevent RAN\nperformance degradation during migration; (ii) accounting for xApp diversity in\nstate size and timing constraints; and (iii) implementing several migration\nstrategies and providing guidelines on best strategies to use based on resource\navailability and requirements.

Our method leverages\nsparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings,\nenabling a quantitative comparison of concept prevalence between real and\ngenerated images. We train an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) on DINOv2 features with\n32,000 concepts -- the largest such SAE to date -- enabling fine-grained\nanalysis of conceptual disparities. Applied to four popular generative models\n(Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, and Kandinsky), our approach reveals\nspecific suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, DVD discs, and whitespaces\non documents) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., wood background texture and\npalm trees). At the individual datapoint level, we further isolate memorization\nartifacts -- instances where models reproduce highly specific visual templates\nseen during training.

This study explores whether a theory-driven learning\nanalytics dashboard (LAD) can enhance human-AI collaboration in the academic\nwriting task by improving writing knowledge gains, fostering self-regulated\nlearning (SRL) skills and building different human-AI dialogue characteristics.\nGrounded in Zimmerman's SRL framework, the LAD provided real-time feedback on\nlearners' goal-setting, writing processes and reflection, while monitoring the\nquality of learner-AI interactions. A quasi-experiment was conducted involving\n52 postgraduate students divided into an experimental group (EG) using the LAD\nto a control group (CG) without it in a human-AI collaborative writing task.\nPre- and post- knowledge tests, questionnaires measuring SRL and cognitive\nload, and students' dialogue data with GenAI were collected and analyzed.\nResults showed that the EG achieved significantly higher writing knowledge\ngains and improved SRL skills, particularly in self-efficacy and cognitive\nstrategies.

However, the conventional wear-leveling (WL) paradigm\napplied during scaling suffers from a fundamental flaw: it ignores the\nnon-linear relationship between wear and failure probability, potentially\npushing the most vulnerable, aged disks towards premature failure. To address\nthis critical issue at its root, we propose the Probability-Sensitive Wear\nLeveling (PS-WL) scheme, which shifts the optimization goal from balancing wear\nto directly balancing failure risk. At its core, PS-WL introduces an \"effective\nlifetime\" model derived from a realistic failure probability to more accurately\nassess disk lifetime. This model guides a PID controller for wear leveling\noperation, with a conservative zone minimizes performance overhead by\nrestricting warm data migration. Comprehensive simulations validate the\nsuperiority of PS-WL over state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate\nthat our approach significantly reduces performance overhead while, most\ncritically, consistently and effectively lowering the aggregated array failure\nrisk across diverse system configurations and workloads.

While quantitative analysis revealed no\nstatistically significant shift in dispositional empathy, qualitative findings\nsuggested the tool facilitated situational empathy, prompted self-reflection,\nimproved emotional resonance, and enhanced workplace relationships.\nParticipants reported feelings of psychological safety, connection, and, in\nsome cases, therapeutic benefits from sharing and responding to stories. These\nresults highlight the promise of asynchronous, structured narrative-based\ndigital tools for supporting empathic engagement in professional settings,\noffering insights for the design of emotionally intelligent workplace\ntechnologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u6545\u4e8b\u5206\u4eab\u5e73\u53f0In Your Shoes\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u804c\u573a\u5171\u60c5\u80fd\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u867d\u672a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u5171\u60c5\u7279\u8d28\uff0c\u4f46\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u60c5\u5883\u5171\u60c5\u548c\u804c\u573a\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5171\u60c5\u662f\u804c\u573a\u5408\u4f5c\u548c\u6c9f\u901a\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u57f9\u517b\u5171\u60c5\u6280\u80fd\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u6570\u5b57\u5de5\u5177\u5982\u4f55\u652f\u6301\u804c\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u5171\u60c5\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u5468\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5171\u60c5\u5546\u6570\uff08EQ\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5171\u60c5\u7279\u8d28\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9a\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5e73\u53f0\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u60c5\u5883\u5171\u60c5\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u804c\u573a\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f02\u6b65\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u53d9\u4e8b\u5de5\u5177\u5bf9\u804c\u573a\u5171\u60c5\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u804c\u573a\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

The widespread usage of sparse data has inspired many in-memory and\non-disk storage formats, but the only widely adopted storage specifications are\nthe Matrix Market and FROSTT file formats, which both use ASCII text. Due to\nthe inefficiency of text storage, these files typically have larger file sizes\nand longer parsing times than binary storage formats, which directly store an\nin-memory representation to disk. This can be a major bottleneck; since sparse\ncomputation is often bandwidth-bound, the cost of loading or storing a matrix\nto disk often exceeds the cost of performing a sparse computation. While it is\ncommon practice for practitioners to develop their own, custom, non-portable\nbinary formats for high-performance sparse matrix storage, there is currently\nno cross-platform binary sparse matrix storage format. We present Binsparse, a\ncross-platform binary sparse matrix and tensor format specification. Binsparse\nis a modular, embeddable format, consisting of a JSON descriptor, which\ndescribes the matrix or tensor dimensions, type, and format, and a series of\nbinary arrays, which can be stored in all modern binary containers, such as\nHDF5, Zarr, or NPZ. We provide several reference implementations of Binsparse\nspanning 5 languages, 5 frameworks, and 4 binary containers.

In this problem, there are $n$ users whose\ndata is statistically heterogeneous, and their optimal parameters share an\nunknown embedding $U^* \\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times k}$ that maps the user parameters\nin $\\mathbb{R}^d$ to low-dimensional representations in $\\mathbb{R}^k$, where\n$k\\ll d$. Our goal is to privately recover the shared embedding and the local\nlow-dimensional representations with small excess risk in the federated\nsetting. We propose a private, efficient federated learning algorithm to learn\nthe shared embedding based on the FedRep algorithm in [CHM+21]. Unlike\n[CHM+21], our algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and our results hold\nfor the case of noisy labels. In contrast to prior work on private model\npersonalization [JRS+21], our utility guarantees hold under a larger class of\nusers' distributions (sub-Gaussian instead of Gaussian distributions).\nAdditionally, in natural parameter regimes, we improve the privacy error term\nin [JRS+21] by a factor of $\\widetilde{O}(dk)$. Next, we consider the binary\nclassification setting. We present an information-theoretic construction to\nprivately learn the shared embedding and derive a margin-based accuracy\nguarantee that is independent of $d$. Our method utilizes the\nJohnson-Lindenstrauss transform to reduce the effective dimensions of the\nshared embedding and the users' data.

While existing privacy\nresearch focuses on gradient-based attacks, the privacy implications of network\ntopology knowledge remain critically understudied. We conduct the first\ncomprehensive analysis of topology-based privacy leakage across realistic\nadversarial knowledge scenarios, demonstrating that adversaries with varying\ndegrees of structural knowledge can infer sensitive data distribution patterns\neven under strong differential privacy guarantees. Through systematic\nevaluation of 4,720 attack instances, we analyze six distinct adversarial\nknowledge scenarios: complete topology knowledge and five partial knowledge\nconfigurations reflecting real-world deployment constraints. We propose three\ncomplementary attack vectors: communication pattern analysis, parameter\nmagnitude profiling, and structural position correlation, achieving success\nrates of 84.1%, 65.0%, and 47.2% under complete knowledge conditions.\nCritically, we find that 80% of realistic partial knowledge scenarios maintain\nattack effectiveness above security thresholds, with certain partial knowledge\nconfigurations achieving performance superior to the baseline complete\nknowledge scenario. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose and\nempirically validate structural noise injection as a complementary defense\nmechanism across 808 configurations, demonstrating up to 51.4% additional\nattack reduction when properly layered with existing privacy techniques. These\nresults establish that network topology represents a fundamental privacy\nvulnerability in federated learning systems while providing practical pathways\nfor mitigation through topology-aware defense mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u65ad\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u68af\u5ea6\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u800c\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u67904,720\u4e2a\u653b\u51fb\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u516d\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u77e5\u8bc6\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u62d3\u6251\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u5411\u91cf\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u62d3\u6251\u77e5\u8bc6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u7387\u53ef\u8d85\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe51.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u662f\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u3002"}}

Our study asked participants to rate\ntheir sense of agency as robot users across four distinct autonomy levels and\nranked their robot preferences with respect to various household tasks. Our\nfindings revealed that participants' sense of agency was primarily influenced\nby two factors: (1) whether the robot acts autonomously, and (2) whether a\nthird party is involved in the robot's programming or operation. Notably, an\nend-user programmed robot highly preserved users' sense of agency, even though\nit acts autonomously.

This article provides a comprehensive\nreview of how LLM-based conversational agents are being used in higher\neducation, with extensions to secondary and lifelong learning contexts. We\nsynthesize existing literature on LLMs in education and theories of\nconversational and dialogic pedagogy - including Vygotsky's sociocultural\nlearning (scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development), the Socratic\nmethod, and Laurillard's conversational framework - and examine how prompting\nstrategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can align LLM behaviors\nwith these pedagogical theories, and how it can support personalized, adaptive\nlearning. We map educational theories to LLM capabilities, highlighting where\nLLM-driven dialogue supports established learning principles and where it\nchallenges or falls short of traditional pedagogical assumptions. Notable gaps\nin applying prior theories to LLMs are identified, such as the models tendency\nto provide direct answers instead of fostering co-construction of knowledge,\nand the need to account for the constant availability and broad but non-human\nexpertise of LLM tutors. In response, we propose practical strategies to better\nalign LLM interactions with sound pedagogy - for example, designing prompts\nthat encourage Socratic questioning, scaffolded guidance, and student\nreflection, as well as integrating retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and\ncontextual relevance.
