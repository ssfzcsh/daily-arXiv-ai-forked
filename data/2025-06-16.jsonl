Such communication relies on time-triggered flows, with each flow\nconsisting of periodic packets originating from a source and destined for a\ndestination node. Each packet needs to reach its destination before its\ndeadline. Different flows can have different cycle lengths. To achieve assured\ntransmission of time-triggered flows, existing efforts constrain the packets of\na flow to be cyclically transmitted along the same path. Under such Fixed\nCyclic Scheduling (FCS), reservation for flows with different cycle lengths can\nbecome incompatible over a shared link, limiting the total number of admissible\nflows. Considering the cycle lengths of different flows, a hyper-cycle has\nlength equal to their least common multiple (LCM). It determines the time\nduration over which the scheduling compatibility of the different flows can be\nchecked. In this work, we propose a more flexible schedule scheme called the\nHypercycle-level Flexible Schedule (HFS) scheme, where a flow's resource\nreservation can change across cycles within a hypercycle. HFS can significantly\nincrease the number of admitted flows by providing more scheduling options\nwhile remaining perfectly compatible with existing Time-Triggered Ethernet\nsystem.

In this scenario, a controller\ndrives safely a vehicle from remote leveraging sensors data generated onboard\nthe vehicle, and exchanged via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. In\nthis work, we tackle the problem of detecting the presence of cars and\npedestrians from point cloud data to enable safe TD operations. More\nspecifically, we exploit the SELMA dataset, a multimodal, open-source,\nsynthetic dataset for autonomous driving, that we expanded by including the\nground-truth bounding boxes of 3D objects to support object detection. We\nanalyze the performance of state-of-the-art compression algorithms and object\ndetectors under several metrics, including compression efficiency,\n(de)compression and inference time, and detection accuracy. Moreover, we\nmeasure the impact of compression and detection on the V2X network in terms of\ndata rate and latency with respect to 3GPP requirements for TD applications."}

The robopatient functions\nas an adaptive intermediary, capable of synthesizing plausible pain expressions\nvocal and facial in response to tactile stimuli generated during palpation.\nUsing an abdominal phantom, robopatient captures and processes haptic input via\nan internal palpation-to-pain mapping model. To evaluate perceptual congruence\nbetween palpation and the corresponding auditory output, we conducted a study\ninvolving 7680 trials across 20 participants, where they evaluated pain\nintensity through sound. Results show that amplitude and pitch significantly\ninfluence agreement with the robot's pain expressions, irrespective of pain\nsounds. Stronger palpation forces elicited stronger agreement, aligning with\npsychophysical patterns. The study revealed two key dimensions: pitch and\namplitude are central to how people perceive pain sounds, with pitch being the\nmost influential cue. These acoustic features shape how well the sound matches\nthe applied force during palpation, impacting perceived realism. This approach\nlays the groundwork for high-fidelity robotic patients in clinical education\nand diagnostic simulation."}

Finally, a lightweight\nyet effective adaptor is incorporated into the PKT task through optimization\nwith two noise feature-based constraints and a navigational regularization\nterm, to correct knowledge states affected by noise.

However, data scarcity poses a significant\nchallenge for machine learning-based sequential-to-parallel code translation.\nAlthough recent back-translation methods show promise, they still fail to\nensure functional equivalence in the translated code. In this paper, we propose\na novel Mutual-Supervised Learning (MSL) framework for sequential-to-parallel\ncode translation to address the functional equivalence issue. MSL consists of\ntwo models, a Translator and a Tester. Through an iterative loop consisting of\nCo-verify and Co-evolve steps, the Translator and the Tester mutually generate\ndata for each other and improve collectively. The Tester generates unit tests\nto verify and filter functionally equivalent translated code, thereby evolving\nthe Translator, while the Translator generates translated code as augmented\ninput to evolve the Tester. Experimental results demonstrate that MuSL\nsignificantly enhances the performance of the base model: when applied to\nQwen2.5-Coder, it not only improves Pass@1 by up to 28.91% and boosts Tester\nperformance by 68.90%, but also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art\nmethod CodeRosetta by 1.56 and 6.92 in BLEU and CodeBLEU scores, while\nachieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1.

Our approach significantly reduces redundant\ntests that would otherwise be performed, without compromising the quality of\nthe reduction.\n  We evaluated PMA against two leading DDMIN-style tools, CHISEL and ProbDD.\nOur findings indicate that PMA cuts processing time by 59.2% compared to\nCHISEL, accelerates the reduction process (i.e., the number of tokens deleted\nper second) by 3.32x, and decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by\n6.7%. Against ProbDD, PMA reduces processing time by 22.0%, achieves a 1.34x\nspeedup in the reduction process, and further decreases the sizes of the final\nreduced programs by 3.0%. These findings affirm PMA's role in significantly\nimproving delta debugging's efficiency while maintaining or enhancing its\neffectiveness."}

However, these high-frequency logs, recorded over\nvarying durations, pose challenges for developers attempting to locate specific\ndriving scenarios. This difficulty arises due to the wide range of signals\nrepresenting various vehicle components and driving conditions, as well as\nunfamiliarity of some developers' with the detailed meaning of these signals.\nTraditional SQL-based querying exacerbates this challenge by demanding both\ndomain expertise and database knowledge, often yielding results that are\ndifficult to verify for accuracy.\n  This paper introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-supported approach that\ncombines signal log data with video recordings from test drives, enabling\nnatural language based scenario searches while reducing the need for\nspecialized knowledge. By leveraging scenario distance graphs and relative gap\nindicators, it provides quantifiable metrics to evaluate the reliability of\nquery results. The method is implemented as an API for efficient database\nquerying and retrieval of relevant records, paired with video frames for\nintuitive visualization.

The\nabundance of online user feedback warrants the automated identification of\nquality characteristics, but the online user feedback's heterogeneity and the\nlack of appropriate training corpora limit the applicability of supervised\nmachine learning. We therefore investigate the viability of three approaches\nthat could be effective in low-data settings: language patterns (LPs) based on\nquality-related keywords, instructions for crowdsourced micro-tasks, and large\nlanguage model (LLM) prompts. We determined the feasibility of each approach\nand then compared their accuracy. For the complex multiclass classification of\nquality characteristics, the LP-based approach achieved a varied precision\n(0.38-0.92) depending on the quality characteristic, and low recall;\ncrowdsourcing achieved the best average accuracy in two consecutive phases\n(0.63, 0.72), which could be matched by the best-performing LLM condition\n(0.66) and a prediction based on the LLMs' majority vote (0.68). Our findings\nshow that in this low-data setting, the two approaches that use crowdsourcing\nor LLMs instead of involving experts achieve accurate classifications, while\nthe LP-based approach has only limited potential.

We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from\nCodeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the\nlikelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every\nproblem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of\nfailed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find\nthat frontier models still have significant limitations: without external\ntools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems\nand 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find\nthat LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced\nalgorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently\nincorrect justifications.

Unfortunately, managing ACs remains a\nchallenge, since maintaining the embedded knowledge in the face of changes\nrequires substantial effort, in the process deterring developers - or worse,\nproducing poorly managed cases that instill false confidence. To address this,\nwe present OntoGSN: an ontology and supporting middleware for managing ACs in\nthe Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) standard.
