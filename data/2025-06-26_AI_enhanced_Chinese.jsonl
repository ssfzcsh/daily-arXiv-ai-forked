However,\nexisting work does not address many of the unique challenges presented by code\nwritten for government applications. In particular, government enterprise\nsoftware is often written in legacy languages like MUMPS or assembly language\ncode (ALC) and the overall token lengths of these systems exceed the context\nwindow size for current commercially available LLMs. Additionally, LLMs are\nprimarily trained on modern software languages and have undergone limited\ntesting with legacy languages, making their ability to understand legacy\nlanguages unknown and, hence, an area for empirical study. This paper examines\nthe application of LLMs in the modernization of legacy government code written\nin ALC and MUMPS, addressing the challenges of input limitations. We\ninvestigate various code-chunking methods to optimize the generation of summary\nmodule comments for legacy code files, evaluating the impact of code-chunking\nmethods on the quality of documentation produced by different LLMs, including\nGPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our results indicate that LLMs\ncan select partition points closely aligned with human expert partitioning. We\nalso find that chunking approaches have significant impact on downstream tasks\nsuch as documentation generation. LLM-created partitions produce comments that\nare up to 20% more factual and up to 10% more useful than when humans create\npartitions. Therefore, we conclude that LLMs can be used as suitable\nreplacements for human partitioning of large codebases during LLM-aided\nmodernization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u653f\u5e9c\u9057\u7559\u4ee3\u7801\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8f93\u5165\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u5757\u548c\u6587\u6863\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u653f\u5e9c\u9057\u7559\u4ee3\u7801\uff08\u5982ALC\u548cMUMPS\uff09\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8d85\u51faLLM\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9057\u7559\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u5757\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u9057\u7559\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6458\u8981\u6a21\u5757\u6ce8\u91ca\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cLLM\uff08\u5982GPT-4o\u3001Claude 3 Sonnet\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u6587\u6863\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "LLM\u7684\u5206\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u5757\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u5757\u5728\u6587\u6863\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u5757\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u9ad820%\uff0c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u9ad810%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u7684\u5408\u9002\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u5757\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Optimal scheduling requires up-to-date network state information\n(i.e., of channel occupancy) to select non-overlapping channels for links in\ninterference regions. However, state sharing among nodes introduces significant\ncommunication overhead, especially as network size or node mobility scale,\nthereby decreasing throughput efficiency of already capacity-limited networks.\nIn this paper, we eschew state sharing while adapting the CS schedule based on\na learning-based channel occupancy prediction. We propose the MiLAAP\nattention-based prediction framework for machine learning models of spectral,\nspatial, and temporal dependencies among network nodes. MiLAAP uses a\nself-attention mechanism that lets each node capture the temporospectral CS\npattern in its interference region and accordingly predict the channel\noccupancy state within that region. Notably, the prediction relies only on\nlocally and passively observed channel activities, and thus introduces no\ncommunication overhead. To deal with node mobility, MiLAAP also uses a\nmulti-head self-attention mechanism that lets each node locally capture the\nspatiotemporal dependencies on other network nodes that can interfere with it\nand accordingly predict the motion trajectory of those nodes. Detecting nodes\nthat enter or move outside the interference region is used to further improve\nthe prediction accuracy of channel occupancy. We show that for dynamic networks\nthat use local CS sequences to support relatively long-lived flow traffics, the\nchannel state prediction accuracy of MiLAAP is remarkably ~100% across\ndifferent node mobility patterns and it achieves zero-shot generalizability\nacross different periods of CS sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6MiLAAP\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5171\u4eab\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u8282\u70b9\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMiLAAP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u591a\u5934\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u9053\u5360\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "MiLAAP\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1100%\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MiLAAP\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u8c03\u5ea6\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We propose \"FemmIR\", a framework to retrieve\nmultimodal results relevant to information needs expressed with multimodal\nqueries by example without any similarity label. Such identification is\nnecessary for real-world applications where data annotations are scarce and\nsatisfactory performance is required without fine-tuning with a common\nframework across applications. We curate a new dataset called MuQNOL for\nbenchmarking progress on this task. Our technique is based on weak supervision\nintroduced through edit distance between samples: graph edit distance can be\nmodified to consider the cost of replacing a data sample in terms of its\nproperties, and relevance can be measured through the implicit signal from the\namount of edit cost among the objects. Unlike metric learning or encoding\nnetworks, FemmIR re-uses the high-level properties and maintains the property\nvalue and relationship constraints with a multi-level interaction score between\ndata samples and the query example provided by the user.

Although\nthe research community has made impressive progress in addressing the\nchallenges of this complex task, existing methods often generate environments\nthat are only front-facing, lack visual fidelity, exhibit limited scene\nunderstanding, and are typically fine-tuned for either indoor or outdoor\nsettings. In this work, we address these issues and propose DreamAnywhere, a\nmodular system for the fast generation and prototyping of 3D scenes. Our system\nsynthesizes a 360{\\deg} panoramic image from text, decomposes it into\nbackground and objects, constructs a complete 3D representation through hybrid\ninpainting, and lifts object masks to detailed 3D objects that are placed in\nthe virtual environment. DreamAnywhere supports immersive navigation and\nintuitive object-level editing, making it ideal for scene exploration, visual\nmock-ups, and rapid prototyping -- all with minimal manual modeling. These\nfeatures make our system particularly suitable for low-budget movie production,\nenabling quick iteration on scene layout and visual tone without the overhead\nof traditional 3D workflows. Our modular pipeline is highly customizable as it\nallows components to be replaced independently. Compared to current\nstate-of-the-art text and image-based 3D scene generation approaches,\nDreamAnywhere shows significant improvements in coherence in novel view\nsynthesis and achieves competitive image quality, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across diverse and challenging scenarios.

As a\nzero-watermarking scheme, our method leaves the original image unaltered and\nlearns a reference signature through optimization in the feature space. The\nproposed framework consists of two key modules. In the first module, a feature\nextractor is trained via noise-adversarial learning to generate representations\nthat are both invariant to distortions and semantically expressive. This is\nachieved by combining adversarial supervision against a distortion\ndiscriminator and a reconstruction constraint to retain image content. In the\nsecond module, we design a learning-based multibit zero-watermarking scheme\nwhere the trained invariant features are projected onto a set of trainable\nreference codes optimized to match a target binary message. Extensive\nexperiments on diverse image datasets and a wide range of distortions show that\nour method achieves state-of-the-art robustness in both feature stability and\nwatermark recovery.

This mechanism further underscores the feasibility of defending\nagainst these attacks with minimal overhead, offering a deployable safeguard\nfor privacy-conscious federated learning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6076\u610f\u68af\u5ea6\u6cc4\u6f0f\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u6765\u9632\u5fa1\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u6cc4\u9732\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6076\u610f\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u64cd\u7eb5\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u4ece\u9632\u5fa1\u8005\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8fd9\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u53ca\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u6076\u610f\u68af\u5ea6\u6cc4\u6f0f\u653b\u51fb\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u64cd\u7eb5\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u672c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u59cb\u524d\u6807\u8bb0\u53ef\u7591\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u65e2\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u91cd\u6784\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53c8\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u9690\u853d\uff1b\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u6781\u5c0f\u5f00\u9500\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6076\u610f\u68af\u5ea6\u6cc4\u6f0f\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6613\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While humans effortlessly detect\ncommunication errors in conversations through both verbal and non-verbal cues,\nrobots face significant challenges in interpreting non-verbal feedback, despite\nadvances in computer vision for recognizing affective expressions. This\nresearch evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning models in detecting\nmiscommunications in robot dialogue. Using a multi-modal dataset of 240\nhuman-robot conversations, where four distinct types of conversational failures\nwere systematically introduced, we assess the performance of state-of-the-art\ncomputer vision models. After each conversational turn, users provided feedback\non whether they perceived an error, enabling an analysis of the models' ability\nto accurately detect robot mistakes. Despite using state-of-the-art models, the\nperformance barely exceeds random chance in identifying miscommunication, while\non a dataset with more expressive emotional content, they successfully\nidentified confused states. To explore the underlying cause, we asked human\nraters to do the same. They could also only identify around half of the induced\nmiscommunications, similarly to our model. These results uncover a fundamental\nlimitation in identifying robot miscommunications in dialogue: even when users\nperceive the induced miscommunication as such, they often do not communicate\nthis to their robotic conversation partner.

This will require new reasoning\nskills, chief amongst them being theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to reason\nabout the \"mental\" states of other agents. However, ToM and other multi-agent\nabilities in LLMs are poorly understood, since existing benchmarks suffer from\nnarrow scope, data leakage, saturation, and lack of interactivity. We thus\npropose Decrypto, a game-based benchmark for multi-agent reasoning and ToM\ndrawing inspiration from cognitive science, computational pragmatics and\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning. It is designed to be as easy as possible in\nall other dimensions, eliminating confounding factors commonly found in other\nbenchmarks. To our knowledge, it is also the first platform for designing\ninteractive ToM experiments.\n  We validate the benchmark design through comprehensive empirical evaluations\nof frontier LLMs, robustness studies, and human-AI cross-play experiments. We\nfind that LLM game-playing abilities lag behind humans and simple\nword-embedding baselines. We then create variants of two classic cognitive\nscience experiments within Decrypto to evaluate three key ToM abilities.\nSurprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art reasoning models are significantly\nworse at those tasks than their older counterparts.
