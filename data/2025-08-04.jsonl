It structures agent memory as a persistent\nfile system with explicit operations: COMMIT, BRANCH, MERGE, and CONTEXT,\nenabling milestone-based checkpointing, exploration of alternative plans, and\nstructured reflection. Our approach empowers agents to manage long-term goals,\nisolate architectural experiments, and recover or hand off memory across\nsessions and agents. Empirically, agents equipped with GCC achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on the SWE-Bench-Lite benchmark, resolving 48.00\nof software bugs, outperforming 26 competitive systems.

However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style\nproperties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts,\nleading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a\n`stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks\ndesigned to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The\nstylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the\nstylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses\nencountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions.\nTo this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for\ndrawing-based 3D animation.

A key challenge is predicting when and where spectrum will be\navailable (i.e., unused by primary licensed users) in order to enable proactive\nand interference-free access. This paper proposes a scalable framework for\nspectrum availability prediction that combines a two-state Markov chain model\nof primary user activity with high-fidelity propagation models from the ITU-R\n(specifically Recommendations P.528 and P.2108). The Markov chain captures\ntemporal occupancy patterns, while the propagation models incorporate path loss\nand clutter effects to determine if primary signals exceed interference\nthresholds at secondary user locations. By integrating these components, the\nproposed method can predict spectrum opportunities both in time and space with\nimproved accuracy.

To effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in this domain, it\nis crucial to have a well-designed benchmark that accurately reflects\nreal-world scenarios and mitigates common pitfalls. Existing LLM test\ngeneration benchmarks are limited by two critical drawbacks: data contamination\nand structurally simple function code. As a result, we often cannot rely on the\nvalidity of scientific conclusions drawn from empirical studies using these\nlimited benchmarks. The empirical evidence presented may be biased due to\ncontamination and may fail to generalize beyond toy programs due to structural\nsimplicity.\n  To address these problems, we introduce ULT (UnLeakedTestbench), a new\nbenchmark specifically designed for function-level unit test generation from\nreal-world Python functions. ULT is constructed through a multi-stage curation\nprocess that ensures high cyclomatic complexity and mitigates test case\ncontamination. With 3,909 carefully selected function-level tasks, ULT provides\na more realistic and challenging evaluation of LLMs' test generation\ncapabilities. We also provide PLT (PreLeakedTestbench), a pair benchmark of ULT\nwith leaked tests designed to enable a controlled analysis of memorization\nversus reasoning in test generation.

However, for\nlarge-scale online service systems that receive a tremendous amount of\nfeedback, it remains a challenging task to identify severe issues from user\nfeedback. Aims: To develop a better feedback-based issue detection approach, it\nis crucial first to gain a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics\nof user feedback in real production systems. Method: In this paper, we conduct\nan empirical study on 50,378,766 user feedback items from six real-world\nservices in a one-billion-user online service system. We first study what users\nprovide in their feedback. We then examine whether certain features of feedback\nitems can be good indicators of severe issues. Finally, we investigate whether\nadopting machine learning techniques to analyze user feedback is reasonable.\nResults: Our results show that a large proportion of user feedback provides\nirrelevant information about system issues. As a result, it is crucial to\nfilter out issue-irrelevant information when processing user feedback.\nMoreover, we find severe issues that cannot be easily detected based solely on\nuser feedback characteristics. Finally, we find that the distributions of the\nfeedback topics in different time intervals are similar. This confirms that\ndesigning machine learning-based approaches is a viable direction for better\nanalyzing user feedback.

They allow for\nadvanced modelling features, such as the expression of rigid concepts, while\nmaintaining desirable reasoning complexity.\n  We consider the extension of C2--the counting two-variable fragment of\nfirst-order logic--by monodic standpoints. At the heart of our work is a\npolynomial-time translation of formulas in this extended formalism into\nstandard, standpoint-free C2, a result that relies on intricate model-theoretic\narguments. Thanks to this translation, the satisfiability problem remains at\nthe same complexity level: NExpTime-complete, as in plain C2. Since our\nformalism subsumes monodic S5 over C2, this result also marks a substantial\nadvancement in the study of first-order modal logics.\n  From a practical standpoint, this means that highly expressive description\nlogics such as SHOIQBs and SROIQBs--which underpin the widely adopted OWL 1 and\nOWL 2 ontology languages standardised by the W3C--can be extended with monodic\nstandpoints without increasing the standard reasoning complexity.\n  We further prove that NExpTime-hardness arises even in significantly less\nexpressive description logics, as long as they include both nominals and\nmonodic standpoints.

In competition-level problems, the LLM solutions sometimes\nintroduce structural issues that are not present in human-written code.\nConclusion: Our findings provide valuable insights into the quality of\nLLM-generated code; however, the introduction of critical issues in more\ncomplex scenarios highlights the need for a systematic evaluation and\nvalidation of LLM solutions. Our work deepens the understanding of the\nstrengths and limitations of LLMs for code generation."}

To address this gap,\nwe present LEO (Linking Electronic Lab Notebooks with OMERO), a web-based\nplatform designed to create and manage links between distributed data systems.\nLEO was initially developed to link objects between Electronic Lab Notebooks\n(ELNs) and OMERO, but its functionality has since been extended through a\nplugin-based architecture, allowing the integration of additional data sources.\nThis extensibility makes LEO a scalable and flexible solution for a wide range\nof microscopy research workflows."}

Over the years, several DBI\napproaches have been proposed based on different technologies and implementing\ndiverse techniques. Every solution tries to overcome certain limitations, but\nthey sometimes bring other shortcomings. Some are specialized for one\nparticular domain or task, while others have a wider scope.\n  In this paper, we shed light into the labyrinth of DBI, bringing together\nprocess-level and whole-system approaches. We depict their building blocks and\nanalyze the underlying instrumentation techniques, comparing their ability to\ninstrument different primitives and run-time events.

The\nproposed system is framed by the variety of user needs and contexts, showing\nexplanations in different visualized forms, including a technically detailed\nversion for AI experts and a simplified one for lay users.

We examined CRC at high\naltitude in two states, rest and post-exercise recovery, and found significant\ndifferences (p < 0.05). Quantitative analysis revealed that recovery involved\nmore frequent yet less stable episodes of synchronization between respiration\nand pulse. Furthermore, we explored the feasibility of non-contact CRC\nmeasurement with remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), observing a strong\ncorrelation with oximeter-based metrics (Pearson r = 0.96).
