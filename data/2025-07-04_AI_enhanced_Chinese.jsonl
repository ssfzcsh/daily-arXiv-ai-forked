In this paper, we\nfirst investigate the root causes of these decoding failures through an\nempirical analysis of token-level entropy during RTL generation. Our findings\nreveal that LLMs exhibit low confidence in regions of structural ambiguity or\nsemantic complexity, showing that standard decoding strategies fail to\ndifferentiate between regions requiring determinism (syntax-critical regions)\nand those that benefit from creative exploratory variability (design-critical\nregions). Then, to overcome this, we introduce DecoRTL, a novel run-time\ndecoding strategy, that is both syntax-aware and contrastive for RTL code\ngeneration. DecoRTL integrates two complementary components: (i)\nself-consistency sampling, which generates multiple candidates and re-ranks\nthem based on token-level agreement to promote correctness while maintaining\ndiversity; and (ii) syntax-aware temperature adaptation, which classifies\ntokens by their syntactical and functional roles and adjusts the sampling\ntemperature accordingly, enforcing low temperature for syntax-critical tokens\nand higher temperature for exploratory ones. Our approach operates entirely at\ninference time without requiring any additional model fine-tuning.

Our evaluation using a ShareGPT dataset shows FUSE reduces the\ntime-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and\n25.4%-36.8% on average with the same energy-per-token for various mobile LLM\nmodels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u65f6\u80fd\u6548\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u63a7\u5668FUSE\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684LLM\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6548\u4f4e\uff0cCPU\u3001GPU\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u5668\u76f8\u4e92\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u5206\u6790LLM\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86FUSE\u8c03\u63a7\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u3002", "result": "FUSE\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u9996\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u548c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6bcf\u4ee4\u724c\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "FUSE\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The difficulty arises from complex system\nstructures, dense service coupling, and limited fault information.

This improves the model's\ndiscriminative ability and generalization performance in the target domain. The\nmodel incorporates a pseudo-label selection strategy. When labeled samples are\nlacking in the target domain, high-confidence predictions are used in training.\nThis enhances the model's ability to recognize minority classes. To evaluate\nthe stability and adaptability of the method in real-world scenarios,\nexperiments are designed under three conditions: label scarcity, class\nimbalance, and heterogeneous node environments.

Creating such detailed face avatars from\nvideos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and\nvirtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static\nfaces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny\nvalley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face\nthrough a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static\nfaces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,\ncomplex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on\npredicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D\nGaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights\nlead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate\nGaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases\nexpressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,\nsplatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires\ninverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix.

Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all\npossible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from\nno previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where\neverything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally\nbelieved? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible\nrequires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions\nmay be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An\napplication where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them\ndogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in\nspecific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate. This is an\nability, not a constraint: the ability of being plastic, equating, dogmatic.\nAmnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable are other abilities. Each\nrevision mechanism owns some of these abilities and lacks the others:\nlexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe,\nmoderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of\nthese revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4fee\u8ba2\u673a\u5236\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u591a\u6837\u6027\u80fd\u529b\u624d\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\u9886\u57df\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u8bbe\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4fee\u8ba2\u673a\u5236\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u4fee\u8ba2\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982\u8bcd\u5178\u5e8f\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4fee\u8ba2\u673a\u5236\u5177\u5907\u7279\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u5982\u5851\u6027\u3001\u5747\u8861\u3001\u6559\u6761\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5404\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u5e94\u6839\u636e\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by\nrecovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the\nreconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical\nproperties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,\neditable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them\nsuitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins.

Deep learning and\ngenerative Artificial Intelligence (AI) have the potential to significantly\nenhance the operation of applications within IoV by facilitating efficient\ndecision-making and predictive capabilities, including intelligent navigation,\nvehicle safety monitoring, accident prevention, and intelligent traffic\nmanagement. Nevertheless, efficiently transmitting and processing the massive\nvolumes of data generated by the IoV in real-time remains a significant\nchallenge, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable wireless channel\nconditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a semantic\ncommunication framework based on channel perception to improve the accuracy and\nefficiency of data transmission.

Current approaches to fairness testing in large language\nmodels (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic\nheuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult\nto scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method\nfor testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific\nresources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach,\nMeta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to\nuncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled\nmodifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second,\nwe propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and\noutput evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and\nclassify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source\ntools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test\ncases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained\nLLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases.\nThe results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs,\nachieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of\nexecutions. Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators,\nwith the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79. Although\nnon-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through\ncareful MR design.

Recent pipeline-based approaches have the potential to\nparallelize communication and computation, which helps reduce inference\nlatency. However, the benefit diminishes when the inference request at the\nnetwork edge is sparse, where pipeline is typically at low utilization. To\nenable efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, we propose\n\\textbf{FlowSpec}, a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding\nframework.

Business process prediction using reinforcement\n  learning and heterogeneous graph neural networks", "summary": "Next activity prediction represents a fundamental challenge for optimizing\nbusiness processes in service-oriented architectures such as microservices\nenvironments, distributed enterprise systems, and cloud-native platforms, which\nenables proactive resource allocation and dynamic service composition. Despite\nthe prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture\nnon-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and\nconditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural\npreservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static\nstructures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual\nprocess complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce\nRLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process\ngraphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining\ntheory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively\ncombining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and\nemploys reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to\nautomatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process\ninstance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with\nrelation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next\nactivity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential\nand non-sequential relationships in service interactions.

We evaluate the practicality of the generated\nattack-representing data within an intrusion detection system (IDS) case study,\nin which we develop and perform an empirical evaluation of two deep neural\nnetwork IDS models using the generated data. In addition to the efficiency and\nscalability of the approach, the performance results of IDS models, high\ndetection and classification capabilities, validate the consistency and\neffectiveness of the generated data as well. In this experience study, we also\nelaborate on the aspects influencing the fidelity of the data to real-world\nscenarios and provide insights into its application.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8f66\u8f7d\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7IDS\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u62df\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CAN\u6d88\u606f\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u5728IDS\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301IDS\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

To accelerate\nalgorithmic progress, a recent benchmark released intracranial recordings from\na paralyzed participant attempting to speak, along with a baseline decoding\nalgorithm. Prior work on the benchmark showed impressive accuracy gains.\nHowever, these gains increased computational costs and were not demonstrated in\na real-time decoding setting. Here, we make three contributions that pave the\nway towards accurate, efficient, and real-time neural speech decoding. First,\nwe incorporate large amounts of time masking during training. On average, over\n$50\\%$ of each trial is masked. Second, we replace the gated recurrent unit\n(GRU) architecture used in the baseline algorithm with a compact Transformer.\nThe Transformer architecture uses $77\\%$ fewer parameters, cuts peak GPU memory\nusage by $36\\%$ relative, and is significantly faster to calibrate relative to\nthe GRU.

This enhances task\neffectiveness and user experience across domains such as assistive robotics,\nteleoperation, and autonomous driving. However, existing shared control\nmethods, based on e.g. Model Predictive Control, Control Barrier Functions, or\nlearning-based control, struggle with feasibility, scalability, or safety\nguarantees, particularly since the user input is unpredictable.\n  To address these challenges, we propose an assistive controller framework\nbased on Constrained Optimal Control Problem that incorporates an\noffline-computed Control Invariant Set, enabling online computation of control\nactions that ensure feasibility, strict constraint satisfaction, and minimal\noverride of user intent.

While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the\nsame instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation\nframeworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This\noverlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences\nin annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a\npopular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in\ntraining ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying\nassumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV.

We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have\naddressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual\nframework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance\nselection, annotator choice, and label representation.
