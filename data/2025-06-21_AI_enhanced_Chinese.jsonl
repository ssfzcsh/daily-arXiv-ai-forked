To address this gap,\nwe introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use\nagents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test\nmodels across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt\ninjection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150\ntasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright\ninfringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to\ninteract with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser,\netc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and\nsafety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and\n0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier\nmodels - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide\ninsights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply\nwith many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt\ninjections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions.

The results reveal a correlation between the\ninstance solvability and the sign of the ensemble averaged mean largest\nLyapunov exponent.

Furthermore, the\npower spectra provide additional information about our system by distinguishing\nbetween regular behavior (peaks) and chaotic behavior (broadband spectrum).\nTherefore, power spectra could be utilized to control whether a DMM operates in\nthe optimal dynamical regime.

Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training\nwith numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets.

Once the training data becomes\nscarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we\npropose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We\noptimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image\npairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are\nused for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and\nevaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new\nbenchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch).

Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can\nconvert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a\none-shot context.

Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling\ncollaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL\nfor MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational\ndemands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and\nheterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of\nfull models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their\nmassive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we\npropose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server\nwhile introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific\nadaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and\ntrainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the\nneed to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and\nlimiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters.

While these libraries are well-optimized for\nconcurrent access to the raw data, they are designed neither to handle a large\nnumber of data objects efficiently nor to create different data objects\nindependently by multiple processes, as they require applications to call data\nobject creation APIs collectively with consistent metadata among all processes.\nApplications that process data gathered from remote sensors, such as particle\ncollision experiments in high-energy physics, may generate data of different\nsizes from different sensors and desire to store them as separate data objects.\nFor such applications, the I/O library's requirement on collective data object\ncreation can become very expensive, as the cost of metadata consistency check\nincreases with the metadata volume as well as the number of processes. To\naddress this limitation, using PnetCDF as an experimental platform, we\ninvestigate solutions in this paper that abide the netCDF file format, as well\nas propose a new file header format that enables independent data object\ncreation. The proposed file header consists of two sections, an index table and\na list of metadata blocks. The index table contains the reference to the\nmetadata blocks and each block stores metadata of objects that can be created\ncollectively or independently. The new design achieves a scalable performance,\ncutting data object creation times by up to 582x when running on 4096 MPI\nprocesses to create 5,684,800 data objects in parallel.

Serving\nthese models requires careful memory management, as their memory usage includes\nstatic weights, dynamic activations, and key-value caches. While static weights\nare constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV\ncaches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for\nefficient memory management. Modern LLM serving systems typically handle\nruntime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory\nmanagement relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a\npage table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction.\nThis virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory\nfragmentation. However, this dual-level approach fundamentally isolates runtime\nmemory and KV cache management, resulting in suboptimal memory utilization\nunder dynamic workloads, which can lead to a nearly 20% drop in throughput.\n  To address these limitations, we propose eLLM, an elastic memory management\nframework inspired by the classical memory ballooning mechanism in operating\nsystems. The core components of eLLM include: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction,\nwhich decouples the virtual address space of tensors from the physical GPU\nmemory, creating a unified and flexible memory pool; (2) an Elastic Memory\nMechanism that dynamically adjusts memory allocation through runtime memory\ninflation and deflation, leveraging CPU memory as an extensible buffer; and (3)\na Lightweight Scheduling Strategy employing SLO-aware policies to optimize\nmemory utilization and effectively balance performance trade-offs under\nstringent SLO constraints.

This approach generates self-contained,\nsemantically coherent units across programming languages and tasks, improving\nperformance on diverse code generation tasks, e.g., boosting Recall@5 by 4.3\npoints on RepoEval retrieval and Pass@1 by 2.67 points on SWE-bench generation.\nOur work highlights the importance of structure-aware chunking for scaling\nretrieval-enhanced code intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "RAG\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u7684\u5206\u5757\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u7834\u574f\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAST\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5757\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5757\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u7684\u5206\u5757\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u7834\u574f\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\uff08AST\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5757\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\\ourwork\uff09\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u5730\u5c06\u5927AST\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u6210\u5c0f\u5757\u5e76\u5408\u5e76\u540c\u7ea7\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9075\u5b88\u5927\u5c0f\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5982Recall@5\u63d0\u53474.3\u70b9\uff0cPass@1\u63d0\u53472.67\u70b9\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u5757\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6269\u5c55\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we present a value-grounded framework for\nevaluating and distilling structured moral reasoning in LLMs. We benchmark 12\nopen-source models across four moral datasets using a taxonomy of prompts\ngrounded in value systems, ethical theories, and cognitive reasoning\nstrategies.

Built upon\nTenstorrent's Tensix architecture, this technology decouples the movement of\ndata from compute, potentially offering increased control to the programmer.\nExploring different optimisation techniques to address the bottlenecks inherent\nin data movement, we demonstrate that for a 2D FFT whilst the Wormhole n300 is\nslower than a server-grade 24-core Xeon Platinum CPU, the Wormhole draws around\n8 times less power and consumes around 2.8 times less energy than the CPU when\ncomputing the Fourier transform.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u8ba8RISC-V\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5728\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08HPC\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u690dFFT\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u80fd\u6548\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfCPU\u3002", "motivation": "RISC-V ISA\u5728HPC\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e3aHPC\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u80fd\u6548\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Cooley-Tukey FFT\u7b97\u6cd5\u79fb\u690d\u5230Tenstorrent Wormhole PCIe RISC-V\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "result": "Wormhole n300\u76842D FFT\u6027\u80fd\u4f4e\u4e8e24\u6838Xeon Platinum CPU\uff0c\u4f46\u529f\u8017\u4f4e8\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u4f4e2.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "RISC-V\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5728\u9ad8\u80fd\u6548\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u4ecd\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

After the model generates an interior\ndesign image, a post-processing module identifies the top ten materials present\nand pairs them with carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) values from a general\nmaterials dictionary. This approach allows designers to immediately evaluate\nenvironmental impacts and refine prompts accordingly. We evaluate the system\nthrough three user tests: (1) no mention of sustainability to the user prior to\nthe prompting process with generative AI, (2) sustainability goals communicated\nto the user before prompting, and (3) sustainability goals communicated along\nwith quantitative CO2e data included in the generative AI outputs. Our\nqualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that the introduction of\nsustainability metrics in the third test leads to more informed design\ndecisions, however, it can also trigger decision fatigue and lower overall\nsatisfaction. Nevertheless, the majority of participants reported incorporating\nsustainability principles into their workflows in the third test, underscoring\nthe potential of integrated metrics to guide more ecologically responsible\npractices.

The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use\ncheckpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an\nadditional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield\nsignificant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases\nand scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose,\nCheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by\na weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state\nof the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However,\nbecause of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover\nfailures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+\nwith out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last\nstages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is\nmimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by\nsimply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover\nthe (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring\nstages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively\nevaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with\nvarying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates\n(5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant\ncomputation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%.

However, integrating\nonline learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL,\nwhere clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In\nreal-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the\ndisjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are\ntypically generated by an \\emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We\nare the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been\noverlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an\nevent-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients\nwere activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively\ncollaborated in the learning process.

We reported prediction errors and examined associations\nbetween BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus,\nhypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months\npost-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for\nthese outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity,\ntime between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and\nrecanalisation outcome.\n  $\\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate\npredictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was\nsignificantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models.\nComparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and\nmultivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the\nassociation between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.\n  $\\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data\ncentralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors,\nand post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in\nstroke care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7f3a\u8840\u6027\u8111\u5352\u4e2d\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u8111\u9f84\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8111\u9f84\u4e0e\u8840\u7ba1\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u53ca\u529f\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "motivation": "\u8111\u9f84\u662f\u53cd\u6620\u8111\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d7\u9690\u79c1\u9650\u5236\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u5206\u6563\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8111\u9f84\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75281674\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u7684FLAIR\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5355\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8111\u9f84\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u8111\u9f84\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7565\u900a\u4e8e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8111\u9f84\u4e0e\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u53ca\u529f\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8111\u9f84\u9884\u6d4b\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u8111\u9f84\u4e0e\u5352\u4e2d\u9884\u540e\u7684\u5173\u8054\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9884\u540e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We\nempirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the\nMetropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference\nmechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention\nnaming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based,\nalways-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that\nhuman-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization\naccuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared\nsign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the\nMH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical\nevidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based\ninteraction.

Human performance baselines are vital for\nthe machine learning community, downstream users, and policymakers to interpret\nAI evaluations. Models are often claimed to achieve \"super-human\" performance,\nbut existing baselining methods are neither sufficiently rigorous nor\nsufficiently well-documented to robustly measure and assess performance\ndifferences. Based on a meta-review of the measurement theory and AI evaluation\nliteratures, we derive a framework with recommendations for designing,\nexecuting, and reporting human baselines. We synthesize our recommendations\ninto a checklist that we use to systematically review 115 human baselines\n(studies) in foundation model evaluations and thus identify shortcomings in\nexisting baselining methods; our checklist can also assist researchers in\nconducting human baselines and reporting results.

Given that language is a verbal task, this gap may have severe\nconsequences for the effectiveness of robots for language teaching tasks. We\naddress this lack of L2 teaching robot voices through three contributions: 1.\nWe address the need for a lightweight and expressive robot voice. Using a\nfine-tuned version of Matcha-TTS, we use emoji prompting to create an\nexpressive voice that shows a range of expressivity over time. The voice can\nrun in real time with limited compute resources. Through case studies, we found\nthis voice more expressive, socially appropriate, and suitable for long periods\nof expressive speech, such as storytelling. 2. We explore how to adapt a\nrobot's voice to physical and social ambient environments to deploy our voices\nin various locations. We found that increasing pitch and pitch rate in noisy\nand high-energy environments makes the robot's voice appear more appropriate\nand makes it seem more aware of its current environment. 3. We create an\nEnglish TTS system with improved clarity for L2 listeners using known\nlinguistic properties of vowels that are difficult for these listeners. We used\na data-driven, perception-based approach to understand how L2 speakers use\nduration cues to interpret challenging words with minimal tense (long) and lax\n(short) vowels in English. We found that the duration of vowels strongly\ninfluences the perception for L2 listeners and created an \"L2 clarity mode\" for\nMatcha-TTS that applies a lengthening to tense vowels while leaving lax vowels\nunchanged. Our clarity mode was found to be more respectful, intelligible, and\nencouraging than base Matcha-TTS while reducing transcription errors in these\nchallenging tense/lax minimal pairs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6559\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5408\u6210\u58f0\u97f3\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u97f3\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u548c\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3aL2\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u6559\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6559\u5b66\u6548\u679c\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684Matcha-TTS\u548c\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5bcc\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\uff1b2. \u6839\u636e\u7269\u7406\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u73af\u5883\u8c03\u6574\u8bed\u97f3\u53c2\u6570\uff1b3. \u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u97f3\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u201cL2\u6e05\u6670\u6a21\u5f0f\u201d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u66f4\u5177\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u3001\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408L2\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u542c\u5199\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6559\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u8868\u8fbe\u6548\u679c\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}
