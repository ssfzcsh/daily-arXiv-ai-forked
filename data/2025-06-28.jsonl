Recently, there has also been growing interest in the reverse\ndirection-humans help chatbots-due to a wide range of benefits including better\nchatbot performance, human well-being, and collaborative outcomes. However,\nlittle research has explored the factors that motivate people to help chatbots.\nTo address this gap, we draw on the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA)\nframework to examine how chatbot anthropomorphism-including human-like\nidentity, emotional expression, and non-verbal expression-influences human\nempathy toward chatbots and their subsequent prosocial behaviors and\nintentions.

Augmenting LLMs with external knowledge is a promising\nsolution to address this issue. However, due to privacy and security concerns,\na vast amount of downstream task-related knowledge remains dispersed and\nisolated across various \"silos,\" making it difficult to access. To bridge this\nknowledge gap, we propose a blockchain-based external knowledge framework that\ncoordinates multiple knowledge silos to provide reliable foundational knowledge\nfor large model retrieval while ensuring data security. Technically, we distill\nknowledge from local data into prompts and execute transactions and records on\nthe blockchain. Additionally, we introduce a reputation mechanism and\ncross-validation to ensure knowledge quality and provide incentives for\nparticipation. Furthermore, we design a query generation framework that\nprovides a direct API interface for large model retrieval. To evaluate the\nperformance of our proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments on\nvarious knowledge sources. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework\nachieves efficient LLM service knowledge sharing in blockchain environments."}

To achieve this, we conducted an investigation into the\nstate of the art of micro frontends, based on both academic and gray\nliterature. We then implemented this architectural style in a marketplace for\nhandcrafted products, which already used microservices. Finally, we evaluated\nthe implementation through a semi-open questionnaire with the developers. At\nthe studied marketplace company, the need for architectural change arose due to\nthe tight coupling between their main system (a Java monolith) and a dedicated\nfrontend system. Additionally, there were deprecated technologies and poor\ndeveloper experience. To address these issues, the micro frontends architecture\nwas adopted, along with the API Gateway and Backend for Frontend patterns, and\ntechnologies such as Svelte and Fastify. Although the adoption of Micro\nFrontends was successful, it was not strictly necessary to meet the company's\nneeds.

This paper presents a study that examines how varying a\nrobot's level of transparency and sociability influences user interpretation,\ndecision-making and perceived trust when faced with conflicting information\nfrom a robot. In a 2 x 2 between-subjects online study, 176 participants\nwatched videos of a Furhat robot acting as a family healthcare assistant and\nsuggesting a fictional user to take medication at a different time from that\nremembered by the user. Results indicate that robot transparency influenced\nusers' interpretation of information discrepancies: with a low transparency\nrobot, the most frequent assumption was that the user had not correctly\nremembered the time, while with the high transparency robot, participants were\nmore likely to attribute the discrepancy to external factors, such as a partner\nor another household member modifying the robot's information. Additionally,\nparticipants exhibited a tendency toward overtrust, often prioritizing the\nrobot's recommendations over the user's memory, even when suspecting system\nmalfunctions or third-party interference. These findings highlight the impact\nof transparency mechanisms in robotic systems, the complexity and importance\nassociated with system access control for multi-user robots deployed in home\nenvironments, and the potential risks of users' over reliance on robots in\nsensitive domains such as healthcare."}

A key capability for this process is the ability\nto generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in\nwhich LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert\nideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should\nalso result in better research after being executed. To test whether\nAI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution\nstudy by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas,\neither written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100\nhours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the\nexperiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP\nresearchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after\nexecution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more\nthan expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement,\neffectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human\nideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review\nscores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is\na flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This\nideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating\ntruly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas\nin the absence of execution outcomes."}

In this work, we\npresent MegaFold, a cross-platform system to accelerate AF3 training. MegaFold\ntackles key bottlenecks through ahead-of-time caching to eliminate GPU idle\ntime from the retrieval-augmented data pipeline, Triton-based kernels for\nmemory-efficient EvoAttention on heterogeneous devices, and deep fusion for\ncommon and critical small operators in AF3. Evaluation on both NVIDIA H200 and\nAMD MI250 GPUs shows that MegaFold reduces peak memory usage of AF3 training by\nup to 1.23$\\times$ and improves per-iteration training time by up-to\n1.73$\\times$ and 1.62$\\times$ respectively.

There is also a growing expectation for them\nto display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this\nexpectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM\npersonalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models\nface two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which\nonly provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for\ncontrolling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity\nas a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable\npersonality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe\nthat changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related\ntraits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize\nmulti-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in\nisolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine\ninteractions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing\nprocesses, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines."}

However, real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting\ndistributions, causing performance degradation known as concept drift. This\npaper analyzes FL performance under concept drift using information theory and\nproposes an algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation. We model concept\ndrift as a Markov chain and introduce the \\emph{Stationary Generalization\nError} to assess a model's capability to capture characteristics of future\nunseen data. Its upper bound is derived using KL divergence and mutual\ninformation. We study three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, and random) and\ntheir impact on FL performance. Inspired by this, we propose an algorithm that\nregularizes the empirical risk minimization approach with KL divergence and\nmutual information, thereby enhancing long-term performance. We also explore\nthe performance-cost tradeoff by identifying a Pareto front. To validate our\napproach, we build an FL testbed using Raspberry Pi4 devices. Experimental\nresults corroborate with theoretical findings, confirming that drift patterns\nsignificantly affect performance.

Despite its promising\npotential, developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems\nremains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability\nof neural activity across individuals and over time, compounded by EEG hardware\nconstraints. While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems,\nexisting approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate\nspatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals. This study\naddresses this gap by introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional\nnetwork (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG)\nclassification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration\nof EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional\nattention network (GCAT) to jointly learn expressive spatiotemporal EEG\nrepresentations. The proposed model significantly outperformed existing MI-EEG\nclassifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a compact\narchitecture, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for BCI\ndeployment.

To achieve this, we conducted an investigation into the\nstate of the art of micro frontends, based on both academic and gray\nliterature. We then implemented this architectural style in a marketplace for\nhandcrafted products, which already used microservices. Finally, we evaluated\nthe implementation through a semi-open questionnaire with the developers. At\nthe studied marketplace company, the need for architectural change arose due to\nthe tight coupling between their main system (a Java monolith) and a dedicated\nfrontend system. Additionally, there were deprecated technologies and poor\ndeveloper experience. To address these issues, the micro frontends architecture\nwas adopted, along with the API Gateway and Backend for Frontend patterns, and\ntechnologies such as Svelte and Fastify. Although the adoption of Micro\nFrontends was successful, it was not strictly necessary to meet the company's\nneeds. According to the analysis of the mixed questionnaire responses, other\nalternatives, such as a monolithic frontend, could have achieved comparable\nresults. What made adopting micro frontends the most convenient choice in the\ncompany's context was the monolith strangulation and microservices adoption,\nwhich facilitated implementation through infrastructure reuse and knowledge\nsharing between teams."}
