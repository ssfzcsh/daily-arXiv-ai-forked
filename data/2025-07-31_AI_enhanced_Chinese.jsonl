To\nbridge these gaps, we present RedCoder, a red-teaming agent that engages victim\nmodels in multi-turn conversation to elicit vulnerable code.

Efficient Directed Fuzzing via Large Language Models", "categories": ["cs.SE", "cs.AI", "cs.CR", "cs.PL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Fuzzing is highly effective in detecting bugs due to the key contribution of\nrandomness. However, randomness significantly reduces the efficiency of\nfuzzing, causing it to cost days or weeks to expose bugs. Even though directed\nfuzzing reduces randomness by guiding fuzzing towards target buggy locations,\nthe dilemma of randomness still challenges directed fuzzers. Two critical\ncomponents, which are seeds and mutators, contain randomness and are closely\ntied to the conditions required for triggering bugs. Therefore, to address the\nchallenge of randomness, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to\nremove the randomness in seeds and reduce the randomness in mutators. With\ntheir strong reasoning and code generation capabilities, LLMs can be used to\ngenerate reachable seeds that target pre-determined locations and to construct\nbug-specific mutators tailored for specific bugs. We propose RandLuzz, which\nintegrates LLMs and directed fuzzing, to improve the quality of seeds and\nmutators, resulting in efficient bug exposure. RandLuzz analyzes function call\nchain or functionality to guide LLMs in generating reachable seeds. To\nconstruct bug-specific mutators, RandLuzz uses LLMs to perform bug analysis,\nobtaining information such as bug causes and mutation suggestions, which\nfurther help generate code that performs bug-specific mutations. We evaluate\nRandLuzz by comparing it with four state-of-the-art directed fuzzers, AFLGo,\nBeacon, WindRanger, and SelectFuzz. With RandLuzz-generated seeds, the fuzzers\nachieve an average speedup ranging from 2.1$\\times$ to 4.8$\\times$ compared to\nusing widely-used initial seeds. Additionally, when evaluated on individual\nbugs, RandLuzz achieves up to a 2.7$\\times$ speedup compared to the\nsecond-fastest exposure.

Recent work, TroVE, argues that code-generating Large Language\nModels (LLMs) can benefit similarly on the MATH benchmark by inducing and\nreusing higher-level toolboxes. By allocating computational budget across an\nensemble of three modes -- directly generating code, creating tools, and\nreusing tools -- TroVE claims to outperform a PRIMITIVE baseline that only\nperforms direct generation. However, recent analysis (Berlot-Attwell et al.,\n2024) casts doubt on these gains, noting that the tools created are often\ntrivial or rarely reused, suggesting that improvements may stem from\nself-consistency or self-correction.

With the exponential\ngrowth in the volume of data in bioinformatics databases, the time, processing\npower, and memory bandwidth for comparing a query sequence with the available\ndatabases grows proportionally. The sequence alignment algorithms often involve\nsimple arithmetic operations and feature high degrees of inherent fine-grained\nand coarse-grained parallelism. These features can be potentially exploited by\na massive parallel processor, such as a GPU, to increase throughput. In this\npaper, we show that the excessive memory bandwidth demand of the sequence\nalignment algorithms prevents exploiting the maximum achievable throughput on\nconventional parallel machines. We then propose a memory-aware architecture to\nreduce the bandwidth demand of the sequence alignment algorithms, effectively\npushing the memory wall to extract higher throughput.

Understanding previous research on\ntraffic management and its effect on traffic efficiency and safety helps\nexplore the integration of Green Wave solutions with smart city initiatives for\neffective traffic signal coordination. This paper also discusses the advantages\nof using Green Wave strategies for emission reduction and considers road safety\nissues for vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists.

Unlike fleeting emotions, personality traits are\nstable, often subconsciously leaked through language, facial expressions, and\nbody behaviors, with asynchronous patterns across modalities. It was hard to\nmodel personality semantics with traditional superficial features and seemed\nimpossible to achieve effective cross-modal understanding. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel personality assessment framework called\n\\textit{\\textbf{Traits Run Deep}}. It employs\n\\textit{\\textbf{psychology-informed prompts}} to elicit high-level\npersonality-relevant semantic representations. Besides, it devises a\n\\textit{\\textbf{Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network}} that anchors rich text\nsemantics to align and integrate asynchronous signals from other modalities. To\nbe specific, such fusion module includes a Chunk-Wise Projector to decrease\ndimensionality, a Cross-Modal Connector and a Text Feature Enhancer for\neffective modality fusion and an ensemble regression head to improve\ngeneralization in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, we are the first to\napply personality-specific prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in\nextracting personality-aware semantics for improved representation quality.\nFurthermore, extracting and fusing audio-visual apparent behavior features\nfurther improves the accuracy.

To recover faithful spatio-temporal content from corrupted inputs,\nbitstream-corrupted video recovery has recently emerged as a challenging and\nunderstudied task. However, existing methods require time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive annotation of corrupted regions for each corrupted video frame,\nresulting in a large workload in practice. In addition, high-quality recovery\nremains difficult as part of the local residual information in corrupted frames\nmay mislead feature completion and successive content recovery. In this paper,\nwe propose the first blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework that\nintegrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, which is adapted to\ndifferent types of corruption and bitstream-level prompts. Within the\nframework, the proposed Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model leverages the rich\npriors of the visual foundation model while incorporating bitstream and\ncorruption knowledge to enhance corruption localization and blind recovery.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC)\nmodule, which adaptively processes residual contributions based on high-level\ncorruption understanding.

In the current paper, we offer an in-depth qualitative account\nof how people initiate opportunistic interactions in social VR. Our\nparticipants consisted of 16 individuals with ongoing experience attending\nVR-mediated events in their professional communities. We conducted extensive\nobservations with each participant during one or more events they attended.

We detailed the unique connections between a person's\nperceived verisimilitude and their social behaviors at each of the three steps\ntoward initiating opportunistic interactions: availability recognition,\nattention capture, and ice-breaking.

Unlike\ntraditional replication, erasure coding enables space efficient redundancy,\nallowing data to be reconstructed from any subset of K out of K plus M coded\nblocks. We dynamically partition each edge server s storage into private and\npublic regions. The private region is further subdivided among access points\nbased on their incoming request rates, enabling adaptive control over data\nlocality and ownership. We design a data placement and replacement policy that\ndetermines how and where to store or evict coded data blocks to maximize data\naccess within deadlines. While the private region serves requests from local\nAPs, the public region handles cooperative storage requests from neighboring\nservers.

The standard LoRa encoder\ncontrols 6 Spreading Factors (SFs) to tradeoff SNR tolerance with data rate.\nSF-12 is the maximum SF providing the lowest SNR tolerance on commercial\noff-the-shelf (COTS) LoRa nodes. In Morph, we develop an SF-configuration based\nencoder to mimic the larger SFs beyond SF-12 while it is compatible with COTS\nLoRa nodes. Specifically, we manipulate four SF configurations of a Morph\nsymbol to encode 2-bit data. Accordingly, we recognize the used SF\nconfiguration of the symbol for data decoding. We leverage a Deep Neural\nNetwork (DNN) decoder to fully capture multi-dimensional features among diverse\nSF configurations to maximize the SNR gain.

To ensure safe and comfortable control transitions,\nit is essential to develop a deep understanding of the key factors influencing\nvarious takeover performance aspects. This study evaluates drivers' takeover\nperformance across three dimensions: response efficiency, user experience, and\ndriving safety - using a driving simulator experiment. EXtreme Gradient\nBoosting (XGBoost) models are used to investigate the contributions of two\ncritical factors, i.e., Situational Awareness (SA) and Spare Capacity (SC), in\npredicting various takeover performance metrics by comparing the predictive\nresults to the baseline models that rely solely on basic Driver Characteristics\n(DC). The results reveal that (i) higher SA enables drivers to respond to\ntakeover requests more quickly, particularly for reflexive responses; and (ii)\nSC shows a greater overall impact on takeover quality than SA, where higher SC\ngenerally leads to enhanced subjective rating scores and objective execution\ntrajectories.

Most existing graph-based\nindexes are designed for the static scenario, where there are no updates to the\ndata after the index is constructed. However, full dynamism (insertions,\ndeletions, and searches) is crucial to providing up-to-date responses in\napplications using vector databases. It is desirable that the index efficiently\nsupports updates and search queries concurrently. Existing dynamic graph-based\nindexes suffer from at least one of the following problems: (1) the query\nquality degrades as updates happen; and (2) the graph structure updates used to\nmaintain the index quality upon updates are global and thus expensive. To solve\nthese problems, we propose the CleANN system which consists of three main\ncomponents: (1) workload-aware linking of diverse search tree descendants to\ncombat distribution shift; (2)query-adaptive on-the-fly neighborhood\nconsolidation to efficiently handle deleted nodes; and (3) semi-lazy memory\ncleaning to clean up stale information in the data structure and reduce the\nwork spent by the first two components.

In the in-memory setting using 56 hyper-threads, with all types of\nqueries running concurrently, at the same recall level, CleANN achieves 7-1200x\nthroughput improvement on million-scale real-world datasets.

S3 combines sigmoid for negative inputs with softsign for\npositive inputs, while S4 employs a smooth transition mechanism controlled by a\nsteepness parameter k. We conducted comprehensive experiments across binary\nclassification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks using three\ndifferent neural network architectures. S4 demonstrated superior performance\ncompared to nine baseline activation functions, achieving 97.4% accuracy on\nMNIST, 96.0% on Iris classification, and 18.7 MSE on Boston Housing regression.\nThe function exhibited faster convergence (-19 for ReLU) and maintained stable\ngradient flow across network depths. Comparative analysis revealed S4's\ngradient range of [0.24, 0.59] compared to ReLU's 18% dead neurons in deep\nnetworks. The S4 activation function addresses key limitations of existing\nfunctions through its hybrid design and smooth transition mechanism.

By reducing cognitive load and physical demands, even in tasks\nrequiring fine motor control and spatial reasoning, VRISE demonstrates the\npotential of immersive, repeatable digital environments to enhance surveying\neducation, broaden participation, and strengthen core competencies in a safe\nand engaging setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "VRISE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u548c\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u4f53\u9a8c\u6539\u8fdb\u4f20\u7edf\u6d4b\u91cf\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6d4b\u91cf\u6559\u80b2\u5b58\u5728\u540e\u52e4\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u5b66\u751f\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86VRISE\u865a\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5730\u9762\u548c\u7a7a\u4e2d\u6d4b\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u3001\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cVRISE\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "VRISE\u901a\u8fc7\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u51cf\u8f7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u91cf\u6559\u80b2\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This is possible as madupite\ncan work in a fully distributed manner and therefore leverage the memory\nstorage and computation capabilities of modern high-performance computing\nclusters. This key feature enables the solver to efficiently handle problems of\nmedium to large size in an exact manner instead of necessarily resorting to\nfunction approximations. Moreover, madupite is unique in allowing users to\ncustomize the solution algorithm to better exploit the specific structure of\ntheir problem, significantly accelerating convergence especially in\nlarge-discount factor settings. Overall, madupite represents a significant\nadvancement, offering unmatched scalability and flexibility in solving\nlarge-scale Markov decision processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Madupite\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u6298\u6263\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MDP\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u5176\u521b\u65b0\u5728\u4e8e\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MDP\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684MDP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1\u65e0\u6298\u6263\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002Madupite\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "Madupite\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b66\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b8c\u5168\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u7528\u6237\u8fd8\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9a\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "Madupite\u5728\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u8d85\u51fa\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684MDP\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u6298\u6263\u56e0\u5b50\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3002", "conclusion": "Madupite\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MDP\u6c42\u89e3\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u4e0e\u4f26\u6bd4\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Our review\nsummarizes the current landscape, identifying frequently evaluated models,\nprogramming tasks, datasets, target languages, and evaluation metrics, and\nhighlights key challenges and future directions for advancing the field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8715\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e8645\u7bc7\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u72b6\u3001\u6311\u6218\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ecd\u5b58\u7591\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u8715\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6210\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u7814\u7a7645\u7bc7\u76f8\u5173\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u8715\u53d8\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u6280\u672f\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e38\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u70b9\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Designed to learn and act independently,\nthese systems operate and perform decision-making without human intervention.\nHowever, they lack the ability to incorporate users' ethical preferences, which\nare unique for each individual in society and are required to personalize the\ndecision-making processes. This reduces user trust and prevents autonomous\nsystems from behaving according to the moral beliefs of their end-users. When\nmultiple systems interact with differing ethical preferences, they must\nnegotiate to reach an agreement that satisfies the ethical beliefs of all the\nparties involved and adjust their behavior consequently. To address this\nchallenge, this paper proposes RobEthiChor, an approach that enables autonomous\nsystems to incorporate user ethical preferences and contextual factors into\ntheir decision-making through ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor features a\ndomain-agnostic reference architecture for designing autonomous systems capable\nof ethic-based negotiating. The paper also presents RobEthiChor-Ros, an\nimplementation of RobEthiChor within the Robot Operating System (ROS), which\ncan be deployed on robots to provide them with ethics-based negotiation\ncapabilities. To evaluate our approach, we deployed RobEthiChor-Ros on real\nrobots and ran scenarios where a pair of robots negotiate upon resource\ncontention. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness\nof the system in realizing ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor allowed robots\nto reach an agreement in more than 73\\% of the scenarios with an acceptable\nnegotiation time (0.67s on average).

We recruited 15\ninformal programming learners who are regular social media users to engage with\nthe system in a self-paced manner; participation concluded upon submitting a\nlearning story and survey. We used three quantitative scales and a qualitative\nsurvey to examine users' characteristics and perceptions of the system's\nsupport for their self-regulation. User feedback suggests the system's\nviability as a self-regulation aid. Learners particularly valued in-situ\nreflection, automated story feedback, and video annotation, while other\nfeatures received mixed views. We highlight perceived benefits, friction\npoints, and design opportunities for future AI-augmented self-regulation tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u5728\u7ebf\u81ea\u5b66\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6545\u4e8b\u548c\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7f16\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u663e\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u81ea\u5b66\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u4eba\u9762\u4e34\u5b64\u7acb\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u8f7d\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u7684\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b9e\u8df5\u542f\u53d1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u7f51\u9875\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u63d2\u4ef6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u901a\u8fc7AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6545\u4e8b\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "15\u540d\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u529f\u80fd\u53d7\u8ba4\u53ef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u793a\u4e86AI\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u7684\u6469\u64e6\u70b9\u3002"}}

Existing techniques for APR are\noften combined with LLMs (Large Language Models), which leverages the\ncode-related knowledge of LLMs to improve repair effectiveness. Current\nLLM-based APR methods typically utilize test cases only during the inference\nstage, adopting an iterative approach that performs repair first and validates\nit through test execution afterward. This conventional paradigm neglects two\nimportant aspects: the potential contribution of test cases in the training\nphase, and the possibility of leveraging testing prior to repair. To address\nthis, we propose Repair-R1, which introduces test cases into the model's\ntraining phase and shifts test generation to precede repair. The model is\nrequired to first generate discriminative test cases that can distinguish\ndefective behaviors, and then perform repair based on these tests. This enables\nthe model to better locate defects and understand the underlying causes of\ndefects, thereby improving repair effectiveness. We implement Repair-R1 with\nthree different backbone models, using RL (reinforcement learning) to\nco-optimize test generation and bug repair. Experimental results on four widely\nadopted benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Repair-R1.

Existing vulnerability\ndetection methods have their limitations: 1) Static analysis methods struggle\nwith complex scenarios. 2) Methods based on specialized pre-trained models\nperform well on specific datasets but have limited generalization capabilities.\nIn contrast, general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate\nimpressive ability in adapting to new vulnerability patterns. However, they\noften underperform on specific vulnerability types compared to methods based on\nspecialized pre-trained models. We also observe that explanations generated by\ngeneral-purpose LLMs can provide fine-grained code understanding information,\ncontributing to improved detection performance.\n  Inspired by these observations, we propose SAEL, an LLM-based framework for\nsmart contract vulnerability detection. We first design targeted prompts to\nguide LLMs in identifying vulnerabilities and generating explanations, which\nserve as prediction features. Next, we apply prompt-tuning on CodeT5 and T5 to\nprocess contract code and explanations, enhancing task-specific performance. To\ncombine the strengths of each approach, we introduce an Adaptive\nMixture-of-Experts architecture. This dynamically adjusts feature weights via a\nGating Network, which selects relevant features using TopK filtering and\nSoftmax normalization, and incorporates a Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism\nto enhance cross-feature relationships. This design enables effective\nintegration of LLM predictions, explanation features, and code features through\ngradient optimization.

Finally, a behavioral experiment confirms that greater AI\nmetacognitive sensitivity improves human decision performance. Together, these\nfindings underscore the importance of evaluating AI assistance not only by\naccuracy but also by metacognitive sensitivity, and of optimizing both to\nachieve superior decision outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u8f85\u52a9\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u540e\u8005\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5176\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790AI\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0AI\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u654f\u611f\u6027\u9ad8\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u8f85\u52a9\u51b3\u7b56\u5e94\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

While these random\nforests often have higher performance and generalize better than a single\ndecision tree, they are also harder to interpret. This paper presents a\nvisualization method and system to increase interpretability of random forests.\nWe cluster similar trees which enables users to interpret how the model\nperforms in general without needing to analyze each individual decision tree in\ndetail, or interpret an oversimplified summary of the full forest. To\nmeaningfully cluster the decision trees, we introduce a new distance metric\nthat takes into account both the decision rules as well as the predictions of a\npair of decision trees. We also propose two new visualization methods that\nvisualize both clustered and individual decision trees: (1) The Feature Plot,\nwhich visualizes the topological position of features in the decision trees,\nand (2) the Rule Plot, which visualizes the decision rules of the decision\ntrees. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a case study on the\n\"Glass\" dataset, which is a relatively complex standard machine learning\ndataset, as well as a small user study.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6811\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u5176\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u805a\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6811\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u53ca\u4e24\u79cd\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728Glass\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5c0f\u578b\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}
