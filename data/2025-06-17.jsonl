However, realistic Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) - the complex\ndynamics between human hands and objects - continues to pose challenges.\nGenerating natural and believable HOI reenactments is difficult due to issues\nsuch as occlusion between hands and objects, variations in object shapes and\norientations, and the necessity for precise physical interactions, and\nimportantly, the ability to generalize to unseen humans and objects. This paper\npresents a novel framework iDiT-HOI that enables in-the-wild HOI reenactment\ngeneration. Specifically, we propose a unified inpainting-based token process\nmethod, called Inp-TPU, with a two-stage video diffusion transformer (DiT)\nmodel. The first stage generates a key frame by inserting the designated object\ninto the hand region, providing a reference for subsequent frames. The second\nstage ensures temporal coherence and fluidity in hand-object interactions. The\nkey contribution of our method is to reuse the pretrained model's context\nperception capabilities without introducing additional parameters, enabling\nstrong generalization to unseen objects and scenarios, and our proposed\nparadigm naturally supports long video generation.

Multiple-row activation is fundamentally different from\nconventional memory access patterns that activate one DRAM row at a time.\nHowever, repeatedly activating even one DRAM row (e.g., RowHammer) can induce\nbitflips in unaccessed DRAM rows because modern DRAM is subject to read\ndisturbance.

In our recent work,\nwe focused on the statics and dynamics of a particular subclass of ANNs, which\nwe refer to as binary ANNs. A binary ANN is a feed-forward network in which\nboth inputs and outputs are restricted to binary values, making it particularly\nsuitable for a variety of practical use cases. Our previous study approached\nbinary ANNs through the lens of belief-change theory, specifically the\nAlchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson (AGM) framework, yielding several key\ninsights. Most notably, we demonstrated that the knowledge embodied in a binary\nANN (expressed through its input-output behaviour) can be symbolically\nrepresented using a propositional logic language. Moreover, the process of\nmodifying a belief set (through revision or contraction) was mapped onto a\ngradual transition through a series of intermediate belief sets. Analogously,\nthe training of binary ANNs was conceptualized as a sequence of such belief-set\ntransitions, which we showed can be formalized using full-meet AGM-style belief\nchange. In the present article, we extend this line of investigation by\naddressing some critical limitations of our previous study. Specifically, we\nshow that Dalal's method for belief change naturally induces a structured,\ngradual evolution of states of belief. More importantly, given the known\nshortcomings of full-meet belief change, we demonstrate that the training\ndynamics of binary ANNs can be more effectively modelled using robust AGM-style\nchange operations -- namely, lexicographic revision and moderate contraction --\nthat align with the Darwiche-Pearl framework for iterated belief change."}

To achieve this, we construct a per-instance\npaired dataset from the close-ups and adapt a pretrained generative model to\nlearn object-specific low-to-high resolution mappings. At inference, we apply\nthe model in a sliding window fashion over the full image. Constructing these\npairs is non-trivial: it requires registering the close-ups within the full\nimage for scale estimation and degradation alignment. We introduce a simple,\nrobust method for getting registration on arbitrary materials in casual,\nin-the-wild captures. Together, these components form a system that enables\nseamless pan and zoom across the entire object, producing consistent,\nphotorealistic gigapixel imagery from minimal input."}

Each component will be analyzed using explainability\ntechniques, such as ALE and SHAP, which have been adapted to analyse the\ndifferent components of these QML algorithms. By combining insights from these\nparts, the paper aims to infer explainability to the overall QML model."}

It is important to accurately calculate the self-heating and thermal\ncrosstalk of devices and to study the electrical and thermal characteristics of\nlogic gates, etc. In this work, a thermal network model considering the thermal\ncrosstalk of neighboring devices is proposed, which can accurately calculate\nthe self-heating and thermal crosstalk.

This study investigates how people interact with AI\ncompanions, especially simulated partners on Character.AI, and how this use is\nassociated with users' psychological well-being. We analyzed survey data from\n1,131 users and 4,363 chat sessions (413,509 messages) donated by 244\nparticipants, focusing on three dimensions of use: nature of the interaction,\ninteraction intensity, and self-disclosure.

Findings suggest that people with smaller\nsocial networks are more likely to turn to chatbots for companionship, but that\ncompanionship-oriented chatbot usage is consistently associated with lower\nwell-being, particularly when people use the chatbots more intensively, engage\nin higher levels of self-disclosure, and lack strong human social support.

State-of-the-art quantum\ncircuit optimizers rely on heuristics and typically require superlinear, and\neven exponential, time. Recent work proposed a new approach that pursues a\nweaker form of optimality called local optimality. Parameterized by a natural\nnumber $\\Omega$, local optimality insists that each and every $\\Omega$-segment\nof the circuit is optimal with respect to an external optimizer, called the\noracle. Local optimization can be performed using only a linear number of calls\nto the oracle but still incurs quadratic computational overheads in addition to\noracle calls. Perhaps most importantly, the algorithm is sequential.\n  In this paper, we present a parallel algorithm for local optimization of\nquantum circuits. To ensure efficiency, the algorithm operates by keeping a set\nof fingers into the circuit and maintains the invariant that a $\\Omega$-deep\ncircuit needs to be optimized only if it contains a finger. Operating in\nrounds, the algorithm selects a set of fingers, optimizes in parallel the\nsegments containing the fingers, and updates the finger set to ensure the\ninvariant. For constant $\\Omega$, we prove that the algorithm requires\n$O(n\\lg{n})$ work and $O(r\\lg{n})$ span, where $n$ is the circuit size and $r$\nis the number of rounds.

Most existing methods\nhave two limitations: (i) low robustness in handling corrupted image data\ncollected by IoT devices; and (ii) high consumption of computational and\ntransmission resources. To this end, we propose the Grouped NonLinear\ntransformation generation method (GroupNL), which generates diversified feature\nmaps by utilizing data-agnostic Nonlinear Transformation Functions (NLFs) to\nimprove the robustness of the CNN model. Specifically, partial convolution\nfilters are designated as seed filters in a convolutional layer, and a small\nset of feature maps, i.e., seed feature maps, are first generated based on\nvanilla convolution operation. Then, we split seed feature maps into several\ngroups, each with a set of different NLFs, to generate corresponding diverse\nfeature maps with in-place nonlinear processing. Moreover, GroupNL effectively\nreduces the parameter transmission between multiple nodes during model training\nby setting the hyperparameters of NLFs to random initialization and not\nupdating them during model training, and reduces the computing resources by\nusing NLFs to generate feature maps instead of most feature maps generated\nbased on sliding windows. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, CIFAR-10-C,\nIcons50, and ImageNet-1K datasets in NVIDIA RTX GPU platforms show that the\nproposed GroupNL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in model robust and\ntraining acceleration.

While more general geospatial search tasks are conceivable, SPOT\nis specifically designed for use in investigative journalism, addressing\nreal-world challenges such as hallucinations in model output, inconsistencies\nin OSM tagging, and the noisy nature of user input. It combines a novel\nsynthetic data pipeline with a semantic bundling system to enable robust,\naccurate query generation. To our knowledge, SPOT is the first system to\nachieve reliable natural language access to OSM data at this level of accuracy.\nBy lowering the technical barrier to geolocation verification, SPOT contributes\na practical tool to the broader efforts to support fact-checking and combat\ndisinformation."}

As Moodle courses become more complex,\nincorporating diverse interactive elements, it is important to understand how\nstudents navigate through course sections and whether course designs are\nmeeting student needs. While substantial research exists on student usage of\nindividual LMS elements, there is a lack of research on broader navigational\npatterns between course sections and how these patterns differ across courses.\nThis study analyzes navigational data from 747 courses in the Moodle LMS at a\ntechnical university of applied sciences, representing (after filtering) around\n4,400 students and 1.8 million logged events. By mapping section names across a\nlarge sample of courses, the analysis enables cross-course comparisons of\nstudent navigational sequences between sections. Transition matrices and heat\nmap visualizations are used to identify common navigational patterns. Findings\ninclude that many of the generated heatmap include one or more diagonal axis,\nindicating that students typically navigate from the current to the next or\nprevious section. More fine-grained patterns show typical behavior for blended\nlearning scenarios. Other patterns include dominant sections."}

At the core of our\napproach is a framework to construct a high-quality visualization critique\ndataset, where we collect human-created visualization instances, synthesize\ncorresponding LLM-generated instances, and construct high-quality critiques. We\nconduct both model-based automatic evaluation and human preference studies to\nevaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Our experiments show that even\nsmall (7B parameters) open-source MLLM models achieve substantial performance\ngains by leveraging our high-quality visualization critique dataset, reaching\nlevels comparable to much larger open-source or even proprietary models.

Responses to this phenomenon have varied. Inflationists hold that at least\nsome folk psychological ascriptions to LLMs are warranted. Deflationists argue\nthat all such attributions of mentality to LLMs are misplaced, often cautioning\nagainst the risk that anthropomorphic projection may lead to misplaced trust or\npotentially even confusion about the moral status of LLMs. We advance this\ndebate by assessing two common deflationary arguments against LLM mentality.\nWhat we term the 'robustness strategy' aims to undercut one justification for\nbelieving that LLMs are minded entities by showing that putatively cognitive\nand humanlike behaviours are not robust, failing to generalise appropriately.\nWhat we term the 'etiological strategy' undercuts attributions of mentality by\nchallenging naive causal explanations of LLM behaviours, offering alternative\ncausal accounts that weaken the case for mental state attributions. While both\nstrategies offer powerful challenges to full-blown inflationism, we find that\nneither strategy provides a knock-down case against ascriptions of mentality to\nLLMs simpliciter. With this in mind, we explore a modest form of inflationism\nthat permits ascriptions of mentality to LLMs under certain conditions.\nSpecifically, we argue that folk practice provides a defeasible basis for\nattributing mental states and capacities to LLMs provided those mental states\nand capacities can be understood in metaphysically undemanding terms (e.g.\nknowledge, beliefs and desires), while greater caution is required when\nattributing metaphysically demanding mental phenomena such as phenomenal\nconsciousness."}

Drawing on a range of\nempirical studies and practical deployments, this paper outlines six key\ninsights that highlight both the opportunities and challenges in using robots\nto promote mental wellbeing. These include (1) the lack of a single, objective\nmeasure of wellbeing, (2) the fact that robots don't need to act as companions\nto be effective, (3) the growing potential of virtual interactions, (4) the\nimportance of involving clinicians in the design process, (5) the difference\nbetween one-off and long-term interactions, and (6) the idea that adaptation\nand personalization are not always necessary for positive outcomes. Rather than\npositioning robots as replacements for human therapists, we argue that they are\nbest understood as supportive tools that must be designed with care, grounded\nin evidence, and shaped by ethical and psychological considerations. Our aim is\nto inform future research and guide responsible, effective use of robots in\nmental health and wellbeing contexts."}
