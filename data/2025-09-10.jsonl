Traditional Object-Oriented\nProgramming (OOP) often intertwines security logic with business functionality,\nleading to code tangling, scattering, and reduced maintainability. This study\ninvestigates the role of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in enhancing secure\nsoftware development by modularizing cross-cutting security concerns. Using a\ncase study approach, we compare AOP-based implementations of security features\nincluding authentication, authorization, input validation, encryption, logging,\nand session management with conventional OOP or middleware-based approaches.\nData collection involves analyzing code quality metrics (e.g., lines of code,\ncoupling, cohesion, modularity index, reusability), performance metrics\n(response time, throughput, memory usage), and maintainability indicators.\nDeveloper feedback is also incorporated to assess integration and debugging\nexperiences. Statistical methods, guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 software quality\nmodel, are applied to evaluate differences across implementations. The findings\ndemonstrate that AOP enhances modularity, reusability, and maintainability of\nsecurity mechanisms, while introducing only minimal performance overhead.

Bodega\nachieves this via a novel roster leases algorithm that safeguards the roster, a\nnew notion of cluster metadata. The roster is a generalization of leadership;\nit tracks arbitrary subsets of replicas as responder nodes for local reads. A\nconsistent agreement on the roster is established through roster leases, an\nall-to-all leasing mechanism that generalizes existing all-to-one leasing\napproaches (Leader Leases, Quorum Leases), unlocking a new point in the\nprotocol design space. Bodega further employs optimistic holding and early\naccept notifications to minimize interruption from interfering writes, and\nincorporates smart roster coverage and lightweight heartbeats to maximize\npracticality. Bodega is a non-intrusive extension to classic consensus; it\nimposes no special requirements on writes other than a responder-covering\nquorum. We implement Bodega and related works in Vineyard, a protocol-generic\nreplicated key-value store written in async Rust. We compare it to previous\nprotocols (Leader Leases, EPaxos, PQR, and Quorum Leases) and two production\ncoordination services (etcd and ZooKeeper). Bodega speeds up average client\nread requests by 5.6x-13.1x on real WAN clusters versus previous approaches\nunder moderate write interference, delivers comparable write performance,\nsupports fast proactive roster changes as well as fault tolerance via leases,\nand closely matches the performance of sequentially-consistent etcd and\nZooKeeper deployments across all YCSB workloads.

Code refactoring improves software quality without changing external\nbehavior. Despite its advantages, its benefits are hindered by the considerable\ncost of time, resources, and continuous effort it demands. Aim. Understanding\nwhy developers refactor, and which metrics capture these motivations, may\nsupport wider and more effective use of refactoring in practice. Method. We\nperformed a large-scale empirical study to analyze developers refactoring\nactivity, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify underlying\nmotivations from version control data, comparing our findings with previous\nmotivations reported in the literature. Results. LLMs matched human judgment in\n80% of cases, but aligned with literature-based motivations in only 47%. They\nenriched 22% of motivations with more detailed rationale, often highlighting\nreadability, clarity, and structural improvements. Most motivations were\npragmatic, focused on simplification and maintainability. While metrics related\nto developer experience and code readability ranked highest, their correlation\nwith motivation categories was weak. Conclusions. We conclude that LLMs\neffectively capture surface-level motivations but struggle with architectural\nreasoning. Their value lies in providing localized explanations, which, when\ncombined with software metrics, can form hybrid approaches. Such integration\noffers a promising path toward prioritizing refactoring more systematically and\nbalancing short-term improvements with long-term architectural goals."}

The compute continuum emerges as a promising solution, enabling\nflexible deployment of microservices across distributed, heterogeneous domains.\nHowever, this paradigm also requires a novel approach to resource allocation\nand service placement, as traditional centralized solutions struggle to scale\neffectively, suffer from latency bottlenecks, and introduce single points of\nfailure. In this paper, we present DREAMS, a decentralized framework that\noptimizes microservice placement decisions collaboratively across different\ncomputational domains. At its core, DREAMS introduces agents that operate\nautonomously within each domain while coordinating globally through a\nRaft-based consensus algorithm and cost-benefit voting. This decentralized\narchitecture enables responsive, privacy-preserving, and fault-tolerant\ncoordination, making it particularly suitable given the growing prevalence of\nmulti-stakeholder scenarios across the compute continuum.

Different from the existing methods, we present an edge-based search\nscheme to find clipping planes (bisectors). A test called point-in-cell is\nfirst set up to tell whether a space point is in a target Voronoi cell or not.\nThen, for each edge of the intermediate domain-cell intersection, we will\nlaunch a clipping only if its two endpoints are respectively inside and outside\nthe corresponding Voronoi cell, where the bisector for the clipping can be\nfound by using a few times of point-in-cell tests. Therefore, our method only\ninvolves the clippings that contribute to the final results, which is a great\nadvantage over the state-of-the-art methods.

Such\ndistributions concentrate radiative energy within a narrow lobe and are highly\nsensitive to changes in view direction. However, existing neural radiosity\nmethods, which primarily rely on positional feature encoding, exhibit notable\nlimitations in capturing these high-frequency, strongly view-dependent radiance\ndistributions. To address this, we propose a highly-efficient approach by\nreflectance-aware ray cone encoding based on the neural radiosity framework,\nnamed neural cone radiosity. The core idea is to employ a pre-filtered\nmulti-resolution hash grid to accurately approximate the glossy BSDF lobe,\nembedding view-dependent reflectance characteristics directly into the encoding\nprocess through continuous spatial aggregation. Our design not only\nsignificantly improves the network's ability to model high-frequency reflection\ndistributions but also effectively handles surfaces with a wide range of\nglossiness levels, from highly glossy to low-gloss finishes.

Understanding\nwhy developers refactor, and which metrics capture these motivations, may\nsupport wider and more effective use of refactoring in practice. Method. We\nperformed a large-scale empirical study to analyze developers refactoring\nactivity, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify underlying\nmotivations from version control data, comparing our findings with previous\nmotivations reported in the literature. Results. LLMs matched human judgment in\n80% of cases, but aligned with literature-based motivations in only 47%.

Most motivations were\npragmatic, focused on simplification and maintainability. While metrics related\nto developer experience and code readability ranked highest, their correlation\nwith motivation categories was weak. Conclusions. We conclude that LLMs\neffectively capture surface-level motivations but struggle with architectural\nreasoning. Their value lies in providing localized explanations, which, when\ncombined with software metrics, can form hybrid approaches.

However, in\nstudio-based design courses, students often struggle to provide feedback due to\na lack of confidence and fear of being judged, which limits their ability to\ndevelop essential feedback-giving skills. Recent advances in large language\nmodels (LLMs) suggest that role-playing with AI agents can let learners engage\nin multi-turn feedback without the anxiety of external judgment or the time\nconstraints of real-world settings. Yet prior studies have raised concerns that\nLLMs struggle to behave like real people in role-play scenarios, diminishing\nthe educational benefits of these interactions. Therefore, designing AI-based\nagents that effectively support learners in practicing and developing\nintellectual reasoning skills requires more than merely assigning the target\npersona's personality and role to the agent. By addressing these issues, we\npresent Feed-O-Meter, a novel system that employs carefully designed LLM-based\nagents to create an environment in which students can practice giving design\nfeedback. The system enables users to role-play as mentors, providing feedback\nto an AI mentee and allowing them to reflect on how that feedback impacts the\nAI mentee's idea development process. A user study (N=24) indicated that\nFeed-O-Meter increased participants' engagement and motivation through\nrole-switching and helped them adjust feedback to be more comprehensible for an\nAI mentee. Based on these findings, we discuss future directions for designing\nsystems to foster feedback skills in design education."}

In this paper, we present DREAMS, a decentralized framework that\noptimizes microservice placement decisions collaboratively across different\ncomputational domains. At its core, DREAMS introduces agents that operate\nautonomously within each domain while coordinating globally through a\nRaft-based consensus algorithm and cost-benefit voting.
