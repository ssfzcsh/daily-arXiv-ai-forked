Previous research tends to evaluate APR tools only for their ability\nto clear violations, neglecting their potential introduction of new (sometimes\nsevere) violations, changes to code functionality and degrading of code\nstructure. There is thus a need for research to develop and assess\ncomprehensive evaluation frameworks for APR tools. This study addresses this\nresearch gap, and evaluates Sorald (a state-of-the-art APR tool) as a proof of\nconcept. Sorald's effectiveness was evaluated in repairing 3,529 SonarQube\nviolations across 30 rules within 2,393 Java code snippets extracted from Stack\nOverflow. Outcomes show that while Sorald fixes specific rule violations, it\nintroduced 2,120 new faults (32 bugs, 2088 code smells), reduced code\nfunctional correctness--as evidenced by a 24% unit test failure rate--and\ndegraded code structure, demonstrating the utility of our framework.

With the advent of 5G networks, which support\nultra-low latency and high bandwidth, streaming high-resolution video at 4K and\nbeyond has become increasingly viable. However, optimizing Quality of\nExperience (QoE) in mobile networks remains challenging due to the complex\ninteractions among Adaptive Bit Rate (ABR) schemes at the application layer, CC\nalgorithms at the transport layer, and Radio Link Control (RLC) queuing at the\nlink layer in the 5G network. While prior studies have largely examined these\ncomponents in isolation, this work presents a comprehensive analysis of the\nimpact of modern active queue management (AQM) strategies, such as RED and L4S,\non video streaming over diverse QUIC implementations--focusing particularly on\ntheir interaction with the RLC buffer in 5G environments and the interplay\nbetween CC algorithms and ABR schemes. Our findings demonstrate that the\neffectiveness of AQM strategies in improving video streaming QoE is\nintrinsically linked to their dynamic interaction with QUIC implementations, CC\nalgorithms and ABR schemes-highlighting that isolated optimizations are\ninsufficient. This intricate interdependence necessitates holistic, cross-layer\nadaptive mechanisms capable of real-time coordination between network,\ntransport and application layers, which are crucial for fully leveraging the\ncapabilities of 5G networks to deliver robust, adaptive, and high-quality video\nstreaming."}

To overcome this limitation,\nthis paper introduces a novel Distributed Shared Layered Storage Quantum\nSimulator (DSLSQS).

In a dynamic environment such as the 3D (Edge-Cloud-Space) Compute\nContinuum, serverless functions face additional challenges due to frequent\nchanges in network topology. As satellites move in and out of the range of\nground stations, functions must make multiple hops to access cloud services,\nleading to high-latency state access and unnecessary data transfers. In this\npaper, we present Databelt, a state management framework for serverless\nworkflows designed for the dynamic environment of the 3D Compute Continuum.\nDatabelt introduces an SLO-aware state propagation mechanism that enables the\nfunction state to move continuously in orbit. Databelt proactively offloads\nfunction states to the most suitable node, such that when functions execute,\nthe data is already present on the execution node or nearby, thus minimizing\nstate access latency and reducing the number of network hops.

When functions\nare fused, Databelt seamlessly retrieves their state as a group, reducing\nredundant network and storage operations and improving overall workflow\nefficiency. Our experimental results show that Databelt reduces workflow\nexecution time by up to 66% and increases throughput by 50% compared to the\nbaselines.

We formalize the class of Universal Dancing\nproblems which require a swarm of $n$ robots starting from any initial\nconfiguration to perform a (periodic or finite) sequence of arbitrary patterns,\nonly provided that each pattern consists of $n$ vertices (including\nmultiplicities). However, we prove that, to be solvable under LUMI, the length\nof the feasible choreographies is bounded by the compositions of $n$ into the\nnumber of colors available to the robots. We provide an algorithm solving the\nUniversal Dancing problem by exploiting the peculiar capability of sequential\nrobots to implement a distributed counter mechanism. Even assuming non-rigid\nmovements, our algorithm ensures spatial homogeneity of the performed\nchoreography."}

Our method has two main components: a dialogue system\nand language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs\nconditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to\ncontrol the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial\nand social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation\nand each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to\ncontrol the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables\nagents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the\nongoing dialogue.\n  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay\nbetween social interactions, steering, and crowding.

Existing static\ncaching strategies mitigate this issue only in the initial navigation phase by\npreloading entry points and multi-hop neighbors, but they fail in the second\nphase where query-dependent nodes must be dynamically accessed to achieve high\nrecall.

The\nsummaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible\npaths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS\ncan find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs\nthat trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that\nrenders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long,\ninput-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense\nthat it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we\nintroduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve\nrefutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked\nGPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software\nVerification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that\nour implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers\n(including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in\nterms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time."}
