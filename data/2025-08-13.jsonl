However, it exposes a new class of timing\nside-channel attacks, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive user inputs via\nshared cache entries. Existing defenses, such as per-user isolation, eliminate\nleakage but degrade performance by up to 38.9% in time-to-first-token (TTFT),\nmaking them impractical for high-throughput deployment. To address this gap, we\nintroduce SafeKV (Secure and Flexible KV Cache Sharing), a privacy-aware\nKV-cache management framework that selectively shares non-sensitive entries\nwhile confining sensitive content to private caches. SafeKV comprises three\ncomponents: (i) a hybrid, multi-tier detection pipeline that integrates\nrule-based pattern matching, a general-purpose privacy detector, and\ncontext-aware validation; (ii) a unified radix-tree index that manages public\nand private entries across heterogeneous memory tiers (HBM, DRAM, SSD); and\n(iii) entropy-based access monitoring to detect and mitigate residual\ninformation leakage. Our evaluation shows that SafeKV mitigates 94% - 97% of\ntiming-based side-channel attacks. Compared to per-user isolation method,\nSafeKV improves TTFT by up to 40.58% and throughput by up to 2.66X across\ndiverse LLMs and workloads. SafeKV reduces cache-induced TTFT overhead from\n50.41% to 11.74% on Qwen3-235B. By combining fine-grained privacy control with\nhigh cache reuse efficiency, SafeKV reclaims the performance advantages of\nglobal sharing while providing robust runtime privacy guarantees for LLM\ninference."}

We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and\nretargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same\nframework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does\nnot constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to\nanother, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when\nretargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to\nfit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen\nset of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion\nsignatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of\nSimon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,\nwe argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says\nexpressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character\nrig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions\nwhen exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these\nwell-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a\nperformance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned\ninverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry\nreconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig\nused by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically\nmeaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting. In order\nto better address real-world scenarios, the fine-tuning relies on implicit\ndifferentiation so that the tracker can be treated as a (potentially\nnon-differentiable) black box."}

However, existing methods face\nlimitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for\ngeneralizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),\n2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)\nbroad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these\nlimitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage\noptimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three\ncriteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to\nestablish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency\nbetween watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance\nacross watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs\nincluding watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be\nwell represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in\nwatermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark\nrepresentation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating\nwatermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly\npenalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to\nidentical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable\nlatent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method.

In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long\noccupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to\nseparate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud\nhelps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.\nSpecifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with\nits own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.\nThen, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for\nsmoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the\nprogress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the\nresource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the\nprompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to\nfurther speed up on-device inference. We implement such a scheme P/D-Device,\nand confirm its superiority over other alternatives. We further propose an\nalgorithm to decide the best settings.

The framework models data and knowledge as modular,\nlogic-aware semantic units: single propositions (statement units) or coherent\ngroups of propositions (compound units). Statement units can model\nmeasurements, observations, or universal relationships, including causal ones,\nand link to methods and evidence. Compound units group related statement units\ninto reusable, semantically coherent knowledge objects.

Second, with the end of Moore's Law, achieving high system efficiency\nis no longer feasible without accounting for the rapid evolution of the\nhardware landscape.\n  Building on the observations above, this thesis adopts a cross-stack approach\nto improving ML system efficiency, presenting solutions that span algorithms,\nsystems, and hardware.

This yields agents that look at conspicuous objects\nwhile overlooking obstacles or task-relevant cues, diminishing realism in a\nvirtual environment. We introduce SCORE, a Symbolic Cognitive Reasoning\nframework for Embodied Head Rotation, a data-agnostic framework that produces\ncontext-aware head movements without task-specific training or hand-tuned\nheuristics.

Moreover, when decoding multiple codewords in parallel, our\nderandomization load-balances the queries per-node, thereby preventing\ncongestion and maintaining a low round complexity.\n  Deterministic decoding of LDCs presents a new challenge: the adversary can\ntarget precisely the (few) nodes that are queried for decoding a certain\ncodeword. We overcome this issue via an adaptive doubling strategy: if a\ndecoding attempt for a codeword fails, the node doubles the number of its\ndecoding attempts. Similarly, when the adversary crashes the decoding node\nitself, we replace it dynamically with two other non-crashed nodes. By\ncarefully combining these two doubling processes, we overcome the challenges\nposed by the combination of a deterministic LDC with a worst case pattern of\ncrashes."}

Sound radiation simulation, a key component of physically based\nsound synthesis, has posed challenges in the context of complex object\nboundaries. Previous methods, such as ghost cell-based finite-difference\ntime-domain (FDTD) wave solver, have struggled to address these challenges,\nleading to large errors and failures in complex boundaries because of the\nlimitation of ghost cells. We present SonicRadiation, a hybrid numerical\nsolution capable of handling complex and dynamic object boundaries in sound\nradiation simulation without relying on ghost cells.

However, a light field display generates only a limited number\nof light rays which results in finite angular and spatial resolutions.\nTherefore, 3D content can be shown with high quality only within a narrow depth\nrange notated as Depth of Field (DoF) around the display screen. Outside this\nrange, due to the appearance of aliasing artifacts, the quality degrades\nproportionally to the distance from the screen.
