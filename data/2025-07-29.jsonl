We\nintroduce a novel taxonomy classifying Web accessibility violations into three\nkey categories - Syntactic, Semantic, and Layout. This taxonomy provides a\nstructured foundation for developing our detection and correction method and\nredefining evaluation metrics. We propose a novel method, AccessGuru, which\ncombines existing accessibility testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto detect violations and applies taxonomy-driven prompting strategies to\ncorrect all three categories. To evaluate these capabilities, we develop a\nbenchmark of real-world Web accessibility violations. Our benchmark quantifies\nsyntactic and layout compliance and judges semantic accuracy through\ncomparative analysis with human expert corrections.

To understand\nthe impact that generic structured merge might have on merge accuracy and\nperformance, we run an experiment with four structured merge tools: two Java\nspecific tools, jDime and Spork, and their generic counterparts, respectively\nLastMerge and Mergiraf. Using each tool, we replay merge scenarios from a\nsignificant dataset, and collect data on runtime, behavioral divergences, and\nmerge accuracy. Our results show no evidence that generic structured merge\nsignificantly impacts merge accuracy.

To this end, we\nextend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel\nframework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo\ncollections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the\nsame viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance\nfield, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language\nfeature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the\nmulti-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process.

While annotation inference can eliminate many errors automatically,\na subset of residual errors -- typically a mix of real bugs and false positives\n-- often persist and can only be resolved via code changes. Manually addressing\nthese errors is tedious and error-prone. Large language models (LLMs) offer a\npromising path toward automating these repairs, but naively-prompted LLMs often\ngenerate incorrect, contextually-inappropriate edits. Resolving a nullability\nerror demands a deep understanding of how a symbol is used across the codebase,\noften spanning methods, classes, and packages.

In a user study with 11 participants, EchoForce achieved a\nfine-tuned user-dependent mean error rate of 9.08% and a user-independent mean\nerror rate of 12.3% using a foundation model. Our system remained accurate\nbetween sessions, hand orientations, and users, overcoming a significant\nlimitation of past force sensing systems.

The present experiments\nexamined how aspects of cognitive load impact training outcomes.\n  Method: Participants learned step-by-step shape assembly in a VR environment.\nCognitive load was manipulated across three dimensions: Intrinsic Load (shape\ncomplexity), Extraneous Load (instruction verbosity), and Germane Load\n(adaptive vs. fixed training). In adaptive training (experiment 1), difficulty\nincreased based on individual performance.

We present Apollo, the first framework that addresses this\ntradeoff by distributing indistinguishable data within a user's social circle,\nwhere trustees hold relevant data and non-trustees store random data. Apollo\neliminates the need to memorize recovery metadata since a user eventually\ngathers sufficient data from her social circle for recovery.

To make the anonymity set\nscalable, Apollo proposes a novel multi-layered secret sharing scheme that\nmitigates the overhead due to the random data distributed among non-trustees.\nFinally, we provide a prototype implementation of Apollo and report on its\nperformance.

Our framework establishes a closed-loop cycle where an\nLLM first \"thinks\" by decomposing high-level commands into actionable plans.\nThe robot then \"acts\" by executing these plans while gathering rich, multimodal\nsensory feedback. Critically, the \"learn\" module processes this feedback to\nfacilitate LLM-driven self-reflection, allowing the agent to perform causal\nanalysis on its failures and generate corrective strategies. These insights are\nstored in an experiential memory to guide future planning cycles. We\ndemonstrate through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world\nthat our T-A-L agent significantly outperforms baseline methods, including\nopen-loop LLMs, Behavioral Cloning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning. Our\nframework achieves over a 97% success rate on complex, long-horizon tasks,\nconverges to a stable policy in an average of just 9 trials, and exhibits\nremarkable generalization to unseen tasks. This work presents a significant\nstep towards developing more robust, adaptive, and truly autonomous robotic\nagents."}

Our approach incorporates a dedicated Causal Physics Module (CPM) and a\nnew training objective called Causal Intervention Loss, encouraging the model\nto learn cause-and-effect relationships from multimodal data. By training the\nmodel to predict the outcomes of hypothetical interventions instead of merely\ncapturing statistical correlations, CWMI develops a robust internal\nrepresentation of physical laws. Experimental results show that CWMI\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on zero-shot physical reasoning\ntasks, including the PIQA benchmark and our newly proposed PhysiCa-Bench\ndataset.

The evaluation of NLU capabilities has become a trending\nresearch topic that attracts researchers in the last few years, resulting in\nthe development of numerous benchmarks. These benchmarks include various tasks\nand datasets in order to evaluate the results of pretrained models via public\nleaderboards. Notably, several benchmarks contain diagnostics datasets designed\nfor investigation and fine-grained error analysis across a wide range of\nlinguistic phenomena. This survey provides a comprehensive review of available\nEnglish, Arabic, and Multilingual NLU benchmarks, with a particular emphasis on\ntheir diagnostics datasets and the linguistic phenomena they covered. We\npresent a detailed comparison and analysis of these benchmarks, highlighting\ntheir strengths and limitations in evaluating NLU tasks and providing in-depth\nerror analysis. When highlighting the gaps in the state-of-the-art, we noted\nthat there is no naming convention for macro and micro categories or even a\nstandard set of linguistic phenomena that should be covered. Consequently, we\nformulated a research question regarding the evaluation metrics of the\nevaluation diagnostics benchmarks: \"Why do not we have an evaluation standard\nfor the NLU evaluation diagnostics benchmarks?\" similar to ISO standard in\nindustry. We conducted a deep analysis and comparisons of the covered\nlinguistic phenomena in order to support experts in building a global hierarchy\nfor linguistic phenomena in future.

While\ntechniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,\ndenoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited\ncontrollability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the\ngeneralization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free\nmulti-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large\nLanguage Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative\nrefinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while\nenhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct\ngeneration. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input\nInterpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates\na standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate\nmodel from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual\nprompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses\naesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for\npotential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also\nsupporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On\nGenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA\nscore comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses\nFLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and\nSD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%.

In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that\nextracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by\nsimultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a\ndecoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input\nvisualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then\nreconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To\nguide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and\nreconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure\nstrong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a\nself-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen\nvisualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color\nordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap\nrepresentation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss.\nWe evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset\nand a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications --\ncolormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to\nvisualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color\npalettes."}
