While recent advances in large language models (LLMs)\nhave shown promise in automating test generation for regression testing, they\noften suffer from limited reasoning about program execution, resulting in\nstagnated coverage growth - a phenomenon known as the coverage plateau. In this\npaper, we present TestWeaver, a novel LLM-based approach that integrates\nlightweight program analysis to guide test generation more effectively.\nTestWeaver introduces three key innovations: (1) it reduces hallucinations and\nimproves focus by supplying the LLM with the backward slice from the target\nline instead of full program context; (2) it identifies and incorporates close\ntest cases - those that share control-flow similarities with the path to the\ntarget line - to provide execution context within the LLM's context window; and\n(3) it enhances LLM's reasoning with execution in-line annotations that encode\nvariable states as comments along executed paths. By equipping LLMs with these\ntargeted and contextualized inputs, TestWeaver improves coverage-guided test\ngeneration and mitigates redundant explorations. Empirical results demonstrate\nthat TestWeaver accelerates code coverage growth and generates more effective\nregression test cases than existing LLM-based approaches."}

This idea is implemented in separation logic by extending\nfirst-order logic with separating connectives, which inspect local regions of\nmemory. It turns that this approach not only applies to pointer programs, but\nalso to programs involving other resource structures. Various theories have\nbeen put forward to extract and apply the ideas of separation logic more\nbroadly.

First-order logic can be understood in\nterms of categorical logic, specifically fibrations. Our contribution is to\nmake these resource-aware by developing categorical logic internally in\ncategories of sheaves, which is what we call sheafeology. The role of sheaves\nis to model views on resources, through which resources can be localised and\ncombined, which enables the scalability promised by separation logic.

Our study with different\ngenerations of NPU chips reveals that 30%-72% of their energy consumption is\ncontributed by static power dissipation, due to the lack of power management\nsupport in modern NPU chips. In this paper, we present ReGate, which enables\nfine-grained power-gating of each hardware component in NPU chips with\nhardware/software co-design. Unlike conventional power-gating techniques for\ngeneric processors, enabling power-gating in NPUs faces unique challenges due\nto the fundamental difference in hardware architecture and program execution\nmodel. To address these challenges, we carefully investigate the power-gating\nopportunities in each component of NPU chips and decide the best-fit power\nmanagement scheme (i.e., hardware- vs. software-managed power gating).\nSpecifically, for systolic arrays (SAs) that have deterministic execution\npatterns, ReGate enables cycle-level power gating at the granularity of\nprocessing elements (PEs) following the inherent dataflow execution in SAs. For\ninter-chip interconnect (ICI) and HBM controllers that have long idle\nintervals, ReGate employs a lightweight hardware-based idle-detection\nmechanism. For vector units and SRAM whose idle periods vary significantly\ndepending on workload patterns, ReGate extends the NPU ISA and allows software\nlike compilers to manage the power gating. With implementation on a\nproduction-level NPU simulator, we show that ReGate can reduce the energy\nconsumption of NPU chips by up to 32.8% (15.5% on average), with negligible\nimpact on AI workload performance.

The topology, built on\n32bit word-width multi-channel 2D-meshes and crossbars, enables the\narea-efficient scale-up of shared-memory clusters. A router remapper is\ndesigned to balance traffic load across interconnect channels. Using TeraNoC,\nwe build a cluster with 1024 single-stage, single-issue cores that share a\n4096-banked L1 memory, implemented in 12nm technology. The low interconnect\nstalls enable high compute utilization of up to 0.85 IPC in compute-intensive,\ndata-parallel key GenAI kernels. TeraNoC only consumes 7.6\\% of the total\ncluster power in kernels dominated by crossbar accesses, and 22.7\\% in kernels\nwith high 2D-mesh traffic. Compared to a hierarchical crossbar-only cluster,\nTeraNoC reduces die area by 37.8\\% and improves area efficiency (GFLOP/s/mm2)\nby up to 98.7\\%, while occupying only 10.9\\% of the logic area."}

The proposed approach\nleverages the benefits of epidemic protocols, such as no reliance on a fixed\nset of validators or leaders, probabilistic guarantees of convergence,\nefficient use of network resources, and tolerance to node and network failures.\nA comparative experimental analysis has been carried out with traditional\nprotocols including PAXOS, RAFT, and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance\n(PBFT), as well as a relatively more recent protocol such as Avalanche, which\nis specifically designed for very large-scale systems. The results illustrate\nhow BECP outperforms them in terms of throughput, scalability and consensus\nlatency. BECP achieves an average of 1.196 times higher throughput in terms of\nconsensus on items and 4.775 times better average consensus latency.\nFurthermore, BECP significantly reduces the number of messages compared to\nAvalanche. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of fully\ndecentralised consensus for blockchain technology based on epidemic protocols."}

We propose\nRouteMark, a framework for IP protection in merged MoE models through the\ndesign of expert routing fingerprints. Our key insight is that task-specific\nexperts exhibit stable and distinctive routing behaviors under probing inputs.\nTo capture these patterns, we construct expert-level fingerprints using two\ncomplementary statistics: the Routing Score Fingerprint (RSF), quantifying the\nintensity of expert activation, and the Routing Preference Fingerprint (RPF),\ncharacterizing the input distribution that preferentially activates each\nexpert. These fingerprints are reproducible, task-discriminative, and\nlightweight to construct. For attribution and tampering detection, we introduce\na similarity-based matching algorithm that compares expert fingerprints between\na suspect and a reference (victim) model. Extensive experiments across diverse\ntasks and CLIP-based MoE architectures show that RouteMark consistently yields\nhigh similarity for reused experts and clear separation from unrelated ones.\nMoreover, it remains robust against both structural tampering (expert\nreplacement, addition, deletion) and parametric tampering (fine-tuning,\npruning, permutation), outperforming weight- and activation-based baseliness.\nOur work lays the foundation for RouteMark as a practical and broadly\napplicable framework for IP verification in MoE-based model merging."}

Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human\nmemory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a\nmajor energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance\nrequires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach,\nEgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate\npower-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving\nsubstantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight\naudio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture\nfrom hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer\nopening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the\nQA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement\nQuestion-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated\nfirst-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure\nthat they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual\nunderstanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames\non average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components\n(e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while\nachieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We\nbelieve this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction\nfor enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use\n-- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their\nkeys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications)."}

Resources other than work have been considered to\nsecure such longest-chain blockchains. In Chia, blocks record the amount of\nspace S (via a proof of space) and sequential computational steps V (via a\nVDF).\n  In this paper, we ask what weight functions {\\Gamma}(S,V,W) (that assign a\nweight to a block as a function of the recorded space, speed, and work) are\nsecure in the sense that whenever the weight of the resources controlled by\nhonest parties is larger than the weight of adversarial parties, the blockchain\nis secure against private double-spending attacks.\n  We completely classify such functions in an idealized \"continuous\" model:\n{\\Gamma}(S,V,W) is secure against private double-spending attacks if and only\nif it is homogeneous of degree one in the timed resources V and W, i.e.,\n{\\alpha}{\\Gamma}(S,V,W)={\\Gamma}(S,{\\alpha}V, {\\alpha}W).

It provides a powerful tool for designing new longest-chain\nblockchains. E.g., consider combining different PoWs to counter centralization,\nsay the Bitcoin PoW W_1 and a memory-hard PoW W_2.

Benefits include protecting the communicator's privacy while\nstill providing a means to express their individuality. In consequence, there\nhas been a surge in means for avatar-based personalization, ranging from\nclassic human representations to animals, food items, and more. However, using\navatars also has drawbacks. Depending on the human-likeness of the avatar and\nthe corresponding disparities between the avatar and the original expresser,\navatars may elicit discomfort or even hinder effective nonverbal communication\nby distorting emotion perception. This study examines the relationship between\nthe human-likeness of virtual avatars and emotion perception for Ekman's six\n\"basic emotions\". Research reveals that avatars with varying degrees of\nhuman-likeness have distinct effects on emotion perception. High human-likeness\navatars, such as human avatars, tend to elicit more negative emotional\nresponses from users, a phenomenon that is consistent with the concept of\nUncanny Valley in aesthetics, which suggests that closely resembling humans can\nprovoke negative emotional responses. Conversely, a raccoon avatar and a shark\navatar, known as cuteness, which exhibit moderate human similarity in this\nstudy, demonstrate a positive influence on emotion perception. Our initial\nresults suggest that the human-likeness of avatars is an important factor for\nemotion perception. The results from the follow-up study further suggest that\nthe cuteness of avatars and their natural facial status may also play a\nsignificant role in emotion perception and elicitation. We discuss practical\nimplications for strategically conveying specific human behavioral messages\nthrough avatars in multiple applications, such as business and counseling."}

The key contributions of our\nwork include a novel precise target localization (PTL) technique that locates\nreflected signals despite spatial disruptions, and an encoder-decoder model\nthat transforms these signals into HPWs, addressing temporal inconsistencies.\nOur evaluation on a large dataset of healthy subjects and arrhythmia patients\nshows that both mCardiacDx and PTL outperform state-of-the-art approach in\narrhythmia monitoring and diagnosis, also demonstrating improved performance in\nhealthy subjects."}

We propose six design guidelines to help designers\noptimize for accurate trustworthiness assessments, thus fostering ethical and\nresponsible human-automation interactions. The proposed guidelines are derived\nfrom existing literature in various fields, such as human-computer interaction,\ncognitive psychology, automation research, user-experience design, and ethics.\nWe are incorporating key principles from the field of pragmatics, specifically\nthe cultivation of common ground (H. H. Clark 1996) and Gricean communication\nmaxims (Grice 1975). These principles are essential for the design of automated\nsystems because the user's perception of the system's trustworthiness is shaped\nby both environmental contexts, such as organizational culture or societal\nnorms, and by situational context, including the specific circumstances or\nscenarios in which the interaction occurs (Hoff and Bashir 2015). Our proposed\nguidelines provide actionable insights for designers to create automated\nsystems that make relevant trustworthiness cues available.

Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and\nprioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select\nactions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce\nff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic\nHierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks\nvia an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type.

This survey provides a\ncomprehensive review of agent workflow systems, spanning academic frameworks\nand industrial implementations. We classify existing systems along two key\ndimensions: functional capabilities (e.g., planning, multi-agent collaboration,\nexternal API integration) and architectural features (e.g., agent roles,\norchestration flows, specification languages). By comparing over 20\nrepresentative systems, we highlight common patterns, potential technical\nchallenges, and emerging trends.

While LLMs for generating code have been widely\nstudied, their role in code modification remains less understood. Although\n\"prompting\" serves as the primary interface for developers to communicate\nintents to LLMs, constructing effective prompts for code modification\nintroduces challenges different from generation. Prior work suggests that\nnatural language summaries may help scaffold this process, yet such approaches\nhave been validated primarily in narrow domains like SQL rewriting. This study\ninvestigates two prompting strategies for LLM-assisted code modification:\nDirect Instruction Prompting, where developers describe changes explicitly in\nfree-form language, and Summary-Mediated Prompting, where changes are made by\nediting the generated summaries of the code. We conducted an exploratory study\nwith 15 developers who completed modification tasks using both techniques\nacross multiple scenarios. Our findings suggest that developers followed an\niterative workflow: understanding the code, localizing the edit, and validating\noutputs through execution or semantic reasoning. Each prompting strategy\npresented trade-offs: direct instruction prompting was more flexible and easier\nto specify, while summary-mediated prompting supported comprehension, prompt\nscaffolding, and control. Developers' choice of strategy was shaped by task\ngoals and context, including urgency, maintainability, learning intent, and\ncode familiarity.

However, since models are\ntrained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that\nsystematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,\nwhere decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to\nprior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique\nchallenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear\nwhether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering\nconditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment\ntask across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,\nmulti-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500\ntrials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In\nindividual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate\nstrong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.\nHowever, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,\nN = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates\n(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal\nescalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and\npersonal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of\nescalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).\nThese findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social\nand organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant\nimplications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised\noperations where such conditions may emerge naturally."}

However, AA remains nowadays confined to a monolingual setting, with\nEnglish being the most investigated one, overlooking the multilingual nature\nand usage of modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce the problem of\nMultilingual Authorship Attribution, which involves attributing texts to human\nor multiple LLM generators across diverse languages.

Project Website: https://cupid.kixlab.org/", "summary": "Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) often assumes users hold\nstatic preferences that reflect globally in all tasks. In reality, humans hold\ndynamic preferences that change depending on the context. As users interact\nwith an LLM in various contexts, they naturally reveal their contextual\npreferences, which a model must infer and apply in future contexts to ensure\nalignment. To assess this, we introduce CUPID, a benchmark of 756 human-curated\ninteraction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. In\neach interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and\nexpresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user\nrequest and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can\ninfer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that\nsatisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary\nLLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from\nmulti-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant\nto a new request -- under 50% precision and 65% recall.
