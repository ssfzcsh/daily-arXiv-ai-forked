Assertions allow expressing\npartial program specifications, which can be verified either at compile time\n(statically) or run time (dynamically). In higher-order programs, assertions\ncan also describe higher-order arguments. While in the context of (C)LP,\nrun-time verification of higher-order assertions has received some attention,\ncompile-time verification remains relatively unexplored. We propose a novel\napproach for statically verifying higher-order (C)LP programs with higher-order\nassertions. Although we use the Ciao assertion language for illustration, our\napproach is quite general and we believe is applicable to similar contexts.\nHigher-order arguments are described using predicate properties -- a special\nkind of property which exploits the (Ciao) assertion language. We refine the\nsyntax and semantics of these properties and introduce an abstract criterion to\ndetermine conformance to a predicate property at compile time, based on a\nsemantic order relation comparing the predicate property with the predicate\nassertions. We then show how to handle these properties using an abstract\ninterpretation-based static analyzer for programs with first-order assertions\nby reducing predicate properties to first-order properties. Finally, we report\non a prototype implementation and evaluate it through various examples within\nthe Ciao system."}

Given a\nlarge input network $G$, a motif $H$ is a small \"pattern\" graph indicative of\nspecial local structure. Motif/pattern mining involves finding all matches of\nthis pattern in the input $G$. The simplest, yet challenging, case of motif\ncounting is when $H$ has three vertices, often called a \"triadic\" query. Recent\nwork has focused on \"temporal graph mining\", where the network $G$ has edges\nwith timestamps (and directions) and $H$ has time constraints.\n  Inspired by concepts in logic and database theory, we introduce the study of\n\"thresholded First Order Logic (FOL) Motif Analysis\" for massive temporal\nnetworks. A typical triadic motif query asks for the existence of three\nvertices that form a desired temporal pattern. An \"FOL\" motif query is obtained\nby having both existential and thresholded universal quantifiers. This allows\nfor query semantics that can mine richer information from networks. A typical\ntriadic query would be \"find all triples of vertices $u,v,w$ such that they\nform a triangle within one hour\".

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our\ntechnique, we conducted a quantitative study, an empirical evaluation of our\ntechnique in a controlled study, and two case studies, exploring twelve\ndatasets with up to two million data point samples."}

To ensure responsible\nand compliant deployment of CodeLLMs, training data detection (TDD) has become\na critical task. While recent TDD methods have shown promise in natural\nlanguage settings, their effectiveness on code data remains largely\nunderexplored. This gap is particularly important given code's structured\nsyntax and distinct similarity criteria compared to natural language. To\naddress this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of seven\nstate-of-the-art TDD methods on source code data, evaluating their performance\nacross eight CodeLLMs. To support this evaluation, we introduce CodeSnitch, a\nfunction-level benchmark dataset comprising 9,000 code samples in three\nprogramming languages, each explicitly labeled as either included or excluded\nfrom CodeLLM training.

Prior\napproaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning to improve performance in code\nreasoning tasks. However, they often show limited gains and fail to generalize\nacross diverse scenarios. We argue this is due to two core issues: the low\nquality of training data and the limitations of supervised fine-tuning, which\nstruggles to teach general reasoning skills. To address these challenges, we\npropose CodeReasoner, a framework that spans both dataset construction and a\ntwo-stage training process. First, we introduce a method to construct datasets\nthat focus on the core execution logic of Python programs. Next, we apply\ninstruction tuning to inject execution-specific knowledge distilled from a\npowerful teacher model.

By using AI to conduct phone interviews, researchers can\nscale quantitative studies while balancing the dual goals of human-like\ninteractivity and methodological rigor. Unlike earlier efforts that used\ninteractive voice response (IVR) technology to automate these surveys, voice AI\nenables a more natural and adaptive respondent experience as it is more robust\nto interruptions, corrections, and other idiosyncrasies of human speech.\n  We built and tested an AI system to conduct quantitative surveys based on\nlarge language models (LLM), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech\nsynthesis technologies. The system was specifically designed for quantitative\nresearch, and strictly adhered to research best practices like question order\nrandomization, answer order randomization, and exact wording.\n  To validate the system's effectiveness, we deployed it to conduct two pilot\nsurveys with the SSRS Opinion Panel and followed-up with a separate\nhuman-administered survey to assess respondent experiences. We measured three\nkey metrics: the survey completion rates, break-off rates, and respondent\nsatisfaction scores. Our results suggest that shorter instruments and more\nresponsive AI interviewers may contribute to improvements across all three\nmetrics studied."}

Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)\nand Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), traditionally seen as the gold standard\nfor securing encryption keys and digital trust, are increasingly challenged by\ncloud-native threats. Real-world breaches have exposed weaknesses in cloud\ndeployments, including misconfigurations, API abuse, and privilege escalations,\nallowing attackers to access sensitive key material and bypass protections.\nThese incidents reveal that while the hardware remains secure, the surrounding\ncloud ecosystem introduces systemic vulnerabilities. This paper analyzes\nnotable security failures involving HSMs and TPMs, identifies common attack\nvectors, and questions longstanding assumptions about their effectiveness in\ndistributed environments. We explore alternative approaches such as\nconfidential computing, post-quantum cryptography, and decentralized key\nmanagement. Our findings highlight that while HSMs and TPMs still play a role,\nmodern cloud security requires more adaptive, layered architectures. By\nevaluating both current weaknesses and emerging models, this research equips\ncloud architects and security engineers with strategies to reinforce\ncryptographic trust in the evolving threat landscape."}

In this report, we present a preview version of\n\\method, which creates a dynamic world from an input image and allows\nexploration of the world using keyboard actions. To achieve this high-fidelity\nand interactive video world generation, we introduce a well-designed framework,\nwhich consists of four main components, including camera motion quantization,\nvideo generation architecture, advanced sampler, and model acceleration. First,\nwe quantize camera motions for stable training and user-friendly interaction\nusing keyboard inputs. Then, we introduce the Masked Video Diffusion\nTransformer~(MVDT) with a memory module for infinite video generation in an\nautoregressive manner. After that, training-free Anti-Artifact Mechanism (AAM)\nand Time Travel Sampling based on Stochastic Differential Equations (TTS-SDE)\nare introduced to the sampler for better visual quality and more precise\ncontrol. Moreover, we investigate model acceleration by synergistic\noptimization of adversarial distillation and caching mechanisms. We use the\nhigh-quality world exploration dataset \\sekai to train \\method, and it achieves\nremarkable results in diverse scenes and applications. All data, codebase, and\nmodel weights are available on https://github.com/stdstu12/YUME. Yume will\nupdate monthly to achieve its original goal.
