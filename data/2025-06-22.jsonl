To address this gap,\nwe introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use\nagents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test\nmodels across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt\ninjection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150\ntasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright\ninfringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to\ninteract with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser,\netc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and\nsafety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and\n0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier\nmodels - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide\ninsights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply\nwith many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt\ninjections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions.

Incorrect\nvisualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information\nconveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual\nbugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause\nobvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data\ngraphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good\nunderstanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is\nessential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz\nlibraries.\n  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz\nlibraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our\nstudy systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a\ndetailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in\nDataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause,\nwhich necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries.\nMoreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test\noracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in\ndesigning effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent\nadvancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of\napplying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show\nthat the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%,\ndepending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not\nnecessarily increase the effectiveness.

In response, we design and implement\nWebXAII, a web-based platform that can embody full experimental protocols,\nmeaning that it can present all aspects of the experiment to human participants\nand record their responses. The experimental protocols are translated into a\ncomposite architecture of generic views and modules, which offers a lot of\nflexibility. The architecture is defined in a structured configuration file, so\nthat protocols can be implemented with minimal programming skills. We\ndemonstrate that WebXAII can effectively embody relevant protocols, by\nreproducing the protocol of a state-of-the-art study of the literature. The\nframework is available at https://github.com/PAJEAN/WebXAII."}

An aspect that has received\nlittle attention so far is how their performance is affected by the numerical\nerrors in the solution of their ODEs and the physical noise they would be\nnaturally subject to if built in hardware. Here, we analyze these two aspects\nin detail by varying the integration time step (numerical noise) and adding\nstochastic perturbations (physical noise) into the equations of DMMs. We are\nparticularly interested in understanding how noise induces a chaotic transition\nthat marks the shift from successful problem-solving to failure in these\nsystems. Our study includes an analysis of power spectra and Lyapunov exponents\ndepending on the noise strength. The results reveal a correlation between the\ninstance solvability and the sign of the ensemble averaged mean largest\nLyapunov exponent. Interestingly, we find a regime in which DMMs with positive\nmean largest Lyapunov exponents still exhibit solvability. Furthermore, the\npower spectra provide additional information about our system by distinguishing\nbetween regular behavior (peaks) and chaotic behavior (broadband spectrum).\nTherefore, power spectra could be utilized to control whether a DMM operates in\nthe optimal dynamical regime.

Although state-of-the-art\ngenerative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in\n3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited\nability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce\nrealistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we\nintroduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement\nlearning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.\nBuilt upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score\nfunction to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our\nNabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D\nreward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning\nbaselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,\nNabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting\nwithin a few finetuning steps."}

In\nreal-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the\ndisjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are\ntypically generated by an \\emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We\nare the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been\noverlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an\nevent-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients\nwere activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively\ncollaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated\n\\emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by\nonline learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary\nenvironment.

Using a\nfine-tuned version of Matcha-TTS, we use emoji prompting to create an\nexpressive voice that shows a range of expressivity over time. The voice can\nrun in real time with limited compute resources. Through case studies, we found\nthis voice more expressive, socially appropriate, and suitable for long periods\nof expressive speech, such as storytelling. 2. We explore how to adapt a\nrobot's voice to physical and social ambient environments to deploy our voices\nin various locations. We found that increasing pitch and pitch rate in noisy\nand high-energy environments makes the robot's voice appear more appropriate\nand makes it seem more aware of its current environment. 3. We create an\nEnglish TTS system with improved clarity for L2 listeners using known\nlinguistic properties of vowels that are difficult for these listeners. We used\na data-driven, perception-based approach to understand how L2 speakers use\nduration cues to interpret challenging words with minimal tense (long) and lax\n(short) vowels in English. We found that the duration of vowels strongly\ninfluences the perception for L2 listeners and created an \"L2 clarity mode\" for\nMatcha-TTS that applies a lengthening to tense vowels while leaving lax vowels\nunchanged. Our clarity mode was found to be more respectful, intelligible, and\nencouraging than base Matcha-TTS while reducing transcription errors in these\nchallenging tense/lax minimal pairs."}

In this work we describe our process of participatory action\nresearch with drivers and trade union organisers, culminating in a\nparticipatory audit of Uber's algorithmic pay and work allocation, before and\nafter the introduction of dynamic pricing. Through longitudinal analysis of 1.5\nmillion trips from 258 drivers in the UK, we find that after dynamic pricing,\npay has decreased, Uber's cut has increased, job allocation and pay is less\npredictable, inequality between drivers is increased, and drivers spend more\ntime waiting for jobs. In addition to these findings, we provide methodological\nand theoretical contributions to algorithm auditing, gig work, and the emerging\npractice of worker data science."}

However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world\nscenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose\nestimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we\nsimulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We\ndeveloped transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and\nestimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we\nshow that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on\nsimulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the\nability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments.\nExperiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and\nsynthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and\nqualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research."}
