In this work, we develop an\nEngineering Agent that fixes the source code based on test failures at scale\nacross diverse software offerings internally.\n  Method: Using Llama as the base, we employ the ReAct harness to develop an\nagent. We start with a test failure that was triaged by a rule-based test\nfailure bot. We then set up an agentic harness and allow the agent to reason\nand run a set of 15 actions from reading a file to generating a patch. We\nprovide feedback to the agent through static analysis and test failures so it\ncan refine its solution. We leverage an LLM-as-a-Judge to ensure that the patch\nconforms to the standards followed by a human review to land fixes.\n  Benchmark Findings: We curated offline benchmarks for our patch generator,\nthe Engineering Agent loop, and the LLM-as-a-Judge.

Standard Kripke models are now considered\n$0$-ary models, whereas an $n$-ary model for $n > 0$ is a model whose set of\nobjects (''possible worlds'') contains only $(n-1)$-ary Kripke models. Models\nwith infinitely many layers are also considered. This framework is obtained by\npromoting a radical change of perspective in how modal semantics for\nnon-classical logics are defined: just like classical modalities are obtained\nthrough use of an accessibility relation between classical propositional\nmodels, non-classical modalities are now obtained through use of an\naccessibility relation between non-classical propositional models (even when\nthey are Kripke models already). The paper introduces the new models after\ndealing specifically with the case of intuitionistic modal logic. It is shown\nthat, depending on which intuitionistic $0$-ary propositional models are\nallowed, we may obtain $1$-ary models equivalent to either birelational models\nfor $IK$ or for a new logic called $MK$. Those $1$-ary models have an intuitive\nreading that adds to the interpretation of intuitionistic models in terms of\n''timelines'' the concept of ''alternative timelines''. More generally, the\n$1$-ary models can be read as defining a concept of ''alternative'' for any\nsubstantive interpretation of the $0$-ary models. The semantic clauses for\nnecessity and possibility of $MK$ are also modular and can be used to obtain\nsimilar modal semantics for every non-classical logic, each of which can be\nprovided with a similar intuitive reading. After intuitionistic modal logic is\ndealt with, the general structure of High-order Kripke Models and some of its\nvariants are defined, and a series of conjectures about their properties are\nstated."}

All these queries rely heavily on\naccurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object\ncounting a critical component of query execution.

To overcome limitations of\nexisting tools, we introduce BUCOR (Build Conflict Resolver), a new conflict\nresolver. BUCOR first detects conflicts by comparing three versions related to\na merging scenario: base b, left l, and right r. To resolve conflicts, it\nemploys two complementary strategies: example-based transformation (BUCOR-E)\nand rule-based transformation (BUCOR-R). BUCOR-R applies predefined rules to\nhandle common, well-understood conflicts. BUCOR-E mines branch versions (l and\nr) for exemplar edits applied to fix related build errors.

Assessing dataset suitability for a task (e.g., training a\nclassification model) is a multi-pronged affair that involves understanding:\ndata characteristics (e.g. granularity, attributes, size), semantics (e.g.,\ndata semantics, creation goals), and relevance to the task at hand. Present-day\ndataset search interfaces are restrictive -- users struggle to convey implicit\npreferences and lack visibility into the search space and result inclusion\ncriteria -- making query iteration challenging. To bridge these gaps, we\nintroduce DataScout to proactively steer users through the process of dataset\ndiscovery via -- (i) AI-assisted query reformulations informed by the\nunderlying search space, (ii) semantic search and filtering based on dataset\ncontent, including attributes (columns) and granularity (rows), and (iii)\ndataset relevance indicators, generated dynamically based on the user-specified\ntask. A within-subjects study with 12 participants comparing DataScout to\nkeyword and semantic dataset search reveals that users uniquely employ\nDataScout's features not only for structured explorations, but also to glean\nfeedback on their search queries and build conceptual models of the search\nspace."}

We provide ACL2s definitions\nof these types, as well as defdata enumerators that are customized to provide\ncode coverage and identify errors in Python programs. Using the ACL2s\nembedding, we can generate instances of types that can then be used as inputs\nto fuzz Python programs, which allows us to identify bugs in Python code that\nare not detected by state-of-the-art Python type checkers. We evaluate our work\nagainst four open-source repositories, extracting their type information and\ngenerating inputs for fuzzing functions with type signatures that are in the\nsupported subset of Python types.

To\naddress this gap, we present RhythmTA, an interactive system for ESL learners\nto practice speech rhythm independently via dubbing, an imitation-based\napproach. The system automatically extracts rhythm from any English speech and\nintroduces novel visual designs to support three stages of dubbing practice:\n(1) Synchronized listening with visual aids to enhance perception, (2) Guided\nrepeating by visual cues for self-adjustment, and (3) Comparative reflection\nfrom a parallel view for self-monitoring.

This study introduces\na Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) assisted active learning framework to optimize the\ncontinuous crystallization of lithium carbonate. By integrating human expertise\nwith data-driven insights, our approach accelerates the optimization of lithium\nextraction from challenging sources. Our results demonstrate the framework's\nability to rapidly adapt to new data, significantly improving the process's\ntolerance to critical impurities like magnesium from the industry standard of a\nfew hundred ppm to as high as 6000 ppm. This breakthrough makes the\nexploitation of low-grade, impurity-rich lithium resources feasible,\npotentially reducing the need for extensive pre-refinement processes. By\nleveraging artificial intelligence, we have refined operational parameters and\ndemonstrated that lower-grade materials can be used without sacrificing product\nquality. This advancement is a significant step towards economically harnessing\nNorth America's vast lithium reserves, such as those in the Smackover\nFormation, and enhancing the sustainability of the global lithium supply chain."}

Evaluating Conversational Forecasting Models", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.HC"], "comment": "Code and data available as part of ConvoKit:\n  https://convokit.cornell.edu", "summary": "We often rely on our intuition to anticipate the direction of a conversation.\nEndowing automated systems with similar foresight can enable them to assist\nhuman-human interactions. Recent work on developing models with this predictive\ncapacity has focused on the Conversations Gone Awry (CGA) task: forecasting\nwhether an ongoing conversation will derail. In this work, we revisit this task\nand introduce the first uniform evaluation framework, creating a benchmark that\nenables direct and reliable comparisons between different architectures. This\nallows us to present an up-to-date overview of the current progress in CGA\nmodels, in light of recent advancements in language modeling. Our framework\nalso introduces a novel metric that captures a model's ability to revise its\nforecast as the conversation progresses."}
