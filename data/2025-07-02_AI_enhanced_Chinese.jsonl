Given a set of\nrequests for deploying virtualized applications, the edge provider has to\ndeploy a maximum number of them to the underlying physical network, subject to\ncapacity constraints. This challenge is known as the virtual network embedding\n(VNE) problem: it models applications as virtual networks, where virtual nodes\nrepresent functions and virtual links represent communication between the\nvirtual nodes.\n  All variants of VNE are known to be strongly NP-hard. Because of its\ncentrality to network virtualization, VNE has been extensively studied. We\nfocus on the online variant of VNE, in which deployment requests are not known\nin advance. This reflects the highly skewed and unpredictable demand intrinsic\nto the edge. Unfortunately, existing solutions to online VNE do not scale well\nwith the number of requests per second and the physical topology size.\n  We propose a novel approach in which our new online algorithm, OLIVE,\nleverages a nearly optimal embedding for an aggregated expected demand. This\nembedding is computed offline. It serves as a plan that OLIVE uses as a guide\nfor handling actual individual requests while dynamically compensating for\ndeviations from the plan.

This limitation\nprevents them from effectively handling complex, dynamic query environments in\nreal-world scenarios. Extensive retraining can lead to the well-known\ncatastrophic forgetting problem, which reduces the LQO generalizability over\ntime. In this paper, we address this limitation and introduce LIMAO (Lifelong\nModular Learned Query Optimizer), a framework for lifelong learning of plan\ncost prediction that can be seamlessly integrated into existing LQOs. LIMAO\nleverages a modular lifelong learning technique, an attention-based neural\nnetwork composition architecture, and an efficient training paradigm designed\nto retain prior knowledge while continuously adapting to new environments. We\nimplement LIMAO in two LQOs, showing that our approach is agnostic to\nunderlying engines. Experimental results show that LIMAO significantly enhances\nthe performance of LQOs, achieving up to a 40% improvement in query execution\ntime and reducing the variance of execution time by up to 60% under dynamic\nworkloads. By leveraging a precise and self-consistent design, LIMAO\neffectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting, ensuring stable and reliable\nplan quality over time.

Optimizing performance in SMT processors faces\nchallenges due to the inter-application interference within each SMT core. To\nmitigate the interference, thread-to-core (T2C) allocation policies play a\npivotal role. State-of-the-art T2C policies work in two steps: i) building a\nper-application performance stack using performance counters and ii) building\nperformance prediction models to identify the best pairs of applications to run\non each core.\n  This paper explores distinct ways to build the performance stack in ARM\nprocessors and introduces the Instructions and Stalls Cycles (ISC) stack, a\nnovel approach to overcome ARM PMU limitations. The ISC stacks are used as\ninputs for a performance prediction model to estimate the applications'\nperformance considering the inter-application interference. The accuracy of the\nprediction model (second step) depends on the accuracy of the performance stack\n(first step); thus, the higher the accuracy of the performance stack, the\nhigher the potential performance gains obtained by the T2C allocation policy.\n  This paper presents SYNPA as a family of T2C allocation policies.\nExperimental results show that $SYNPA4$, the best-performing SYNPA variant,\noutperforms turnaround time by 38\\% over Linux, which represents 3$\\times$ the\ngains achieved by the state-of-the-art policies for ARM processors.\nFurthermore, the multiple discussions and refinements presented throughout this\npaper can be applied to other SMT processors from distinct vendors and are\naimed at helping performance analysts build performance stacks for accurate\nperformance estimates in real processors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728ARM\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u5806\u6808\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ISC\u5806\u6808\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86SYNPA\u7cfb\u5217\u7ebf\u7a0b\u5230\u6838\u5fc3\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3SMT\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7ebf\u7a0b\u5230\u6838\u5fc3\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u5806\u6808\uff08\u5982ISC\u5806\u6808\uff09\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86SYNPA\u7cfb\u5217\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u7b56\u7565SYNPA4\u5c06\u5468\u8f6c\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u5347\u4e8638%\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8eARM\u5904\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5176\u4ed6SMT\u5904\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

To\naddress this issue, we propose to break down graph queries into more\nfine-grained, primitive operators, enabling a step-by-step evaluation through\nsmaller-scale circuits. Accordingly, the verification with ZKP circuits of\ncomplex graph queries can be decomposed into a series of composable\ncryptographic primitives, each designed to verify a fundamental structural\nproperty such as path ordering or edge directionality. Especially, having\nnoticed that the graph expansion (i.e., traversing from nodes to their\nneighbors along edges) operation serves as the backbone of graph query\nevaluation, we design the expansion centric operator decomposition. In addition\nto constructing circuits for the expansion primitives, we also design\nspecialized ZKP circuits for the various attributes that augment this\ntraversal. The circuits are meticulously designed to take advantage of PLONKish\narithmetization.

We introduce MultiCodeIF, a comprehensive benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate instruction-following in code generation across multiple\ndimensions: constraint type, hierarchical levels, and iterative refinement.\nBuilt upon a structured taxonomy of 9 categories and 27 constraint types,\nMultiCodeIF enables granular assessment of both functional and non-functional\ninstruction adherence. Using an automated pipeline, ConstraGen, we synthesize\nand evolve 2,021 code tasks sourced from 14 programming languages, supporting\nmulti-turn evaluation through feedback-driven task variants. Empirical\nevaluation of six state-of-the-art LLMs uncovers substantial performance\ndisparities. The top-performing model, Claude-3-7-Sonnet, achieves 63.0%\naverage constraint satisfaction, while smaller models like Qwen3-1.7B fall to\n44.8%. Models perform well on explicit constraints, but struggle with implicit\nor abstract constraints. Tasks with multiple hierarchical constraints\nsignificantly reduce model success rates, from 54.5% in single-level to just\n18.8% in multi-level scenarios. However, structured feedback enables\nprogressive improvement: average constraint satisfaction rises from 63.0% to\n83.4% over four iterative refinement rounds. MultiCodeIF provides a scalable,\nconstraint-aware, and feedback-sensitive framework to benchmark LLMs under\nrealistic code generation scenarios, bridging the gap between synthetic\nevaluations and real-world instruction complexity.

Numerous enumeration\nalgorithms have been developed for this purpose. To be a statistically\nmeaningful representation of the whole join result, the result tuples are\nrequired to be enumerated in uniformly random order. However, existing studies\nlack an efficient random-order enumeration algorithm with a worst-case runtime\nguarantee for (cyclic) join queries. In this paper, we study the problem of\nenumerating the results of a join query in random order. We develop an\nefficient random-order enumeration algorithm for join queries with no large\nhidden constants in its complexity, achieving expected\n$O(\\frac{\\mathrm{AGM}(Q)}{|Res(Q)|}\\log^2|Q|)$ delay,\n$O(\\mathrm{AGM}(Q)\\log|Q|)$ total running time after $O(|Q|\\log|Q|)$-time index\nconstruction, where $|Q|$ is the size of input, $\\mathrm{AGM}(Q)$ is the AGM\nbound, and $|Res(Q)|$ is the size of the join result.

However, our previous study identified two major\nlimitations in ParaGrapher: inefficient utilization of high-bandwidth storage\nand reduced decompression bandwidth due to increased compression ratios. To\naddress these limitations, we present two optimizations for ParaGrapher in this\npaper. To improve storage utilization, particularly for high-bandwidth storage,\nwe introduce ParaGrapher-FUSE (PG-Fuse) a filesystem based on the FUSE\n(Filesystem in User Space). PG-Fuse optimizes storage access by increasing the\nsize of requested blocks, reducing the number of calls to the underlying\nfilesystem, and caching the received blocks in memory for future calls. To\nimprove the decompression bandwidth, we introduce CompBin, a compact binary\nrepresentation of the CSR format. CompBin facilitates direct accesses to\nneighbors while preventing storage usage for unused bytes. Our evaluation on 12\nreal-world and synthetic graphs with up to 128 billion edges shows that PG-Fuse\nand CompBin achieve up to 7.6 and 21.8 times speedup, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Therefore, efficient network traffic prediction and\nanomaly detection methods are crucial for network security and traffic\nmanagement. This paper proposes a novel network traffic prediction and anomaly\ndetection model, MamNet, which integrates time-domain modeling and\nfrequency-domain feature extraction. The model first captures the long-term\ndependencies of network traffic through the Mamba module (time-domain\nmodeling), and then identifies periodic fluctuations in the traffic using\nFourier Transform (frequency-domain feature extraction). In the feature fusion\nlayer, multi-scale information is integrated to enhance the model's ability to\ndetect network traffic anomalies. Experiments conducted on the UNSW-NB15 and\nCAIDA datasets demonstrate that MamNet outperforms several recent mainstream\nmodels in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. Specifically, it achieves an\nimprovement of approximately 2% to 4% in detection performance for complex\ntraffic patterns and long-term trend detection. The results indicate that\nMamNet effectively captures anomalies in network traffic across different time\nscales and is suitable for anomaly detection tasks in network security and\ntraffic management.

Leveraging 21 million interactions on X\nduring the 2024 U.S. presidential election, we construct LLM agents based on\n1,186 real users, prompting them to reply to politically salient tweets under\ncontrolled conditions. Agents are initialized either with minimal ideological\ncues (Zero Shot) or recent tweet history (Few Shot), allowing one-to-one\ncomparisons with human replies. We evaluate three model families (Gemini,\nMistral, and DeepSeek) across linguistic style, ideological consistency, and\ntoxicity. We find that richer contextualization improves internal consistency\nbut also amplifies polarization, stylized signals, and harmful language. We\nobserve an emergent distortion that we call \"generation exaggeration\": a\nsystematic amplification of salient traits beyond empirical baselines.

To relieve these challenges, we propose HelixPipe,\na novel pipeline parallelism for long sequence transformer training.

Second, it employs a two-fold\nfirst-in-last-out micro batch schedule to balance memory usage and overlap\ncommunication with computation. Additionally, HelixPipe utilizes recomputation\nwithout attention and chunked MLP to mitigate fragmentation and enable longer\nsequences. Experiments demonstrate that HelixPipe gains increasing advantages\nwith longer sequence lengths, and outperforms existing methods in throughput\nand scalability across varying pipeline sizes, model sizes, and cluster\nconfigurations.

In this scoping review,\nwe examined 26 empirical studies on interactions between people with dementia\nand physical social robots. We identify four key design cue categories that may\ninfluence deceptive impressions: cues resembling physiological signs (e.g.,\nsimulated breathing), social intentions (e.g., playful movement), familiar\nbeings (e.g., animal-like form and sound), and, to a lesser extent, cues that\nreveal artificiality. Thematic analysis of user responses reveals that people\nwith dementia often attribute biological, social, and mental capacities to\nrobots, dynamically shifting between awareness and illusion. These findings\nunderscore the fluctuating nature of ontological perception in dementia\ncontexts. Existing definitions of robotic deception often rest on philosophical\nor behaviorist premises, but rarely engage with the cognitive mechanisms\ninvolved. We propose an empirically grounded definition: robotic deception\noccurs when Type 1 (automatic, heuristic) processing dominates over Type 2\n(deliberative, analytic) reasoning, leading to misinterpretation of a robot's\nartificial nature.

This review synthesizes recent\nadvances at the intersection of risk-informed decision making, human\nreliability assessment (HRA), artificial intelligence (AI), and cognitive\nscience to clarify how their convergence can curb human-error risk. We first\ncategorize the principal forms of human error observed in complex\nsociotechnical environments and outline their quantitative impact on system\nreliability.

Building on these foundations, we\ncritically assess AI-enabled techniques for real-time error detection,\noperator-state estimation, and AI-augmented HRA workflows. Across these\nstrands, a recurring insight emerges: integrating cognitive models with\nAI-based analytics inside risk-informed HRA pipelines markedly enhances\npredictive fidelity, yet doing so demands richer datasets, transparent\nalgorithms, and rigorous validation.

As part of this work, we introduce FiboSB, a novel\nand challenging 6D pose video dataset featuring groups of three participants\nsolving an interactive task featuring small hand-held cubes and a weight scale.\nThis setup poses unique challenges for 6D pose because groups are holistically\nrecorded from a distance in order to capture all participants -- this, coupled\nwith the small size of the cubes, makes 6D pose estimation inherently\nnon-trivial. We evaluated four state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation methods on\nFiboSB, exposing the limitations of current algorithms on collaborative group\nwork. An error analysis of these methods reveals that the 6D pose methods'\nobject detection modules fail. We address this by fine-tuning YOLO11-x for\nFiboSB, achieving an overall mAP_50 of 0.898.
