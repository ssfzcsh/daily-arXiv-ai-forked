This paper proposes a novel\nLLM-Guided Semantic Relational Reasoning (LGSRR) method, which harnesses the\nexpansive knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to establish semantic\nfoundations that boost smaller models' relational reasoning performance.\nSpecifically, an LLM-based strategy is proposed to extract fine-grained\nsemantics as guidance for subsequent reasoning, driven by a shallow-to-deep\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) that autonomously uncovers, describes, and ranks\nsemantic cues by their importance without relying on manually defined priors.\nBesides, we formally model three fundamental types of semantic relations\ngrounded in logical principles and analyze their nuanced interplay to enable\nmore effective relational reasoning.

Sequences are parameterized by\nthe element data type and provide operations such as accessing elements,\nconcatenation, forming sub-sequences and updating elements. Strings and\nsequences are intimately related; many operations, e.g., matching a string\naccording to a regular expression, splitting strings, or joining strings in a\nsequence, are frequently used in string-manipulating programs. Nevertheless,\nthese operations are typically not directly supported by existing SMT solvers,\nwhich instead only consider the generic theory of sequences. In this paper, we\npropose a theory of string sequences and study its satisfiability. We show\nthat, while it is undecidable in general, the decidability can be recovered by\nrestricting to the straight-line fragment.

On multi-million-row datasets, SmartDiff\nachieves over 95 percent precision and recall, runs 30 to 40 percent faster,\nand uses 30 to 50 percent less memory than baselines; in user studies, it\nreduces root-cause analysis time from 10 hours to 12 minutes. An LLM-assisted\nlabeling pipeline produces deterministic, schema-valid multilabel explanations\nusing retrieval augmentation and constrained decoding; ablations show further\ngains in label accuracy and time to diagnosis over rules-only baselines. These\nresults indicate SmartDiff's utility for migration validation, regression\ntesting, compliance auditing, and continuous data quality monitoring.

To efficiently compute the optimal allocations that\nsatisfy the CDR Rule, we propose the General Water-Filling (GWF) method, a more\ngeneral version of classical water-filling in wireless communications.\nCombining these insights, we design the SmartFill Algorithm to solve the\ngeneral scheduling problem. Unlike heSRPT, which always allocates resources to\nall active jobs, SmartFill selectively determines which jobs should receive\nresources and how much they should be allocated. For a broad class of so-called\n\\emph{regular} speedup functions, SmartFill yields closed-form optimal\nsolutions, while for non-regular functions it efficiently computes the optimum\nwith low complexity. Numerical evaluations show that SmartFill can\nsubstantially outperform heSRPT across a wide range of concave speedup\nfunctions."}

In terms of software abstraction, HiCR is naturally located between\ndistributed heterogeneous systems and runtime systems. We coin the phrase\n\\emph{Runtime Support Layer} for this level of abstraction. We explain how the\nmodel's components and operations are realized by a plugin-based approach that\ntakes care of device-specific implementation details, and present examples of\nHiCR-based applications that operate equally on a diversity of platforms."}

In this\ncontext, we introduce in this paper, FlexNGIA 2.0, an Agentic AI-driven\nInternet architecture that leverages LLM-based AI agents to autonomously\norchestrate, configure, and evolve the network. These agents can, at runtime,\nperceive, reason, coordinate among themselves to dynamically design, implement,\ndeploy, and adapt communication protocols, Service Function Chains (SFCs),\nnetwork functions, resource allocation strategies, congestion control, and\ntraffic engineering schemes, thereby ensuring optimal performance, reliability,\nand efficiency under evolving conditions.\n  The paper first outlines the overall architecture of FlexNGIA 2.0 and its\nconstituent LLM-Based AI agents. For each agent, we detail its design,\nimplementation, inputs and outputs, prompt structures, interactions with tools\nand other agents, followed by preliminary proof-of-concept experiments\ndemonstrating its operation and potential. The results clearly highlight the\nability of these LLM-based AI agents to automate the design, the\nimplementation, the deployment, and the performance evaluation of transport\nprotocols, service function chains, network functions, congestion control\nschemes, and resource allocation strategies.\n  FlexNGIA 2.0 paves the way for a new class of Agentic AI-Driven networks,\nwhere fully cognitive, self-evolving AI agents can autonomously design,\nimplement, adapt and optimize the network's protocols, algorithms, and\nbehaviors to efficiently operate across complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous\nenvironments.

These methods guarantee to report all subsequences whose\nestimated unweighted Jaccard similarity with the query exceeds a user-provided\nthreshold and are efficient. However, they fail to account for token importance\nor frequency, which limits their use in real scenarios where tokens carry\nweights, such as TF-IDF. To address this, we propose MONO, an approach that\nsupports weighted Jaccard similarity using consistent weighted sampling. MONO\nachieves optimality within the hash-based framework. For example, when token\nweights are proportional to frequencies, MONO generates O(n + n log f) groups\nin expectation for a text of length n, where f is the maximum token frequency.\nEach group takes O(1) space and represents a few subsequences sharing the same\nsampling.

We can do so by directly computing the probability mass of the set of\nall finite paths from the initial state to G; however, when refining\ncounterexamples, it is also interesting to compute the probability mass of\nsubsets of paths. This can be achieved by splitting the computation into path\nabstractions that calculate \"local\" reachability probabilities as shown by\n\\'Abrah\\'am et al. in 2010. In this paper, we complete and extend their work:\nWe prove that splitting the computation into path abstractions indeed yields\nthe same result as the direct approach, and that the splitting does not need to\nfollow the SCC structure. In particular, we prove that path abstraction can be\nperformed along any finite sequence of sets of non-goal states.

Allocating more resources to a job accelerates its\ncompletion, but with diminishing returns. Prior work (heSRPT) solved this\nproblem only for some specific speedup functions with an exponential form,\nproviding a closed-form solution. However, the general case with arbitrary\nconcave speedup functions -- which more accurately capture real-world workloads\n-- has remained open.\n  In this paper, we solve this open problem by developing optimal scheduling\nalgorithms for parallel jobs under general concave speedup functions. We first\ndiscover a fundamental and broadly-applicable rule for optimal parallel\nscheduling, namely the Consistent Derivative Ratio (CDR) Rule, which states\nthat the ratio of the derivatives of the speedup functions across active jobs\nremains constant over time. To efficiently compute the optimal allocations that\nsatisfy the CDR Rule, we propose the General Water-Filling (GWF) method, a more\ngeneral version of classical water-filling in wireless communications.\nCombining these insights, we design the SmartFill Algorithm to solve the\ngeneral scheduling problem. Unlike heSRPT, which always allocates resources to\nall active jobs, SmartFill selectively determines which jobs should receive\nresources and how much they should be allocated. For a broad class of so-called\n\\emph{regular} speedup functions, SmartFill yields closed-form optimal\nsolutions, while for non-regular functions it efficiently computes the optimum\nwith low complexity. Numerical evaluations show that SmartFill can\nsubstantially outperform heSRPT across a wide range of concave speedup\nfunctions."}

In this\ncontext, the age of information (AoI) has emerged as a critical performance\nmetric for evaluating the freshness and timeliness of transmitted information\nin Internet of things (IoT) networks. However, conventional AAV-assisted data\ntransmission is fundamentally limited by finite communication coverage ranges,\nwhich requires periodic return flights for data relay operations. This\npropulsion-repositioning cycle inevitably introduces latency spikes that raise\nthe AoI while degrading service reliability. To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes a AAV-assisted forwarding system based on distributed\nbeamforming to enhance the AoI in IoT. Specifically, AAVs collaborate via\ndistributed beamforming to collect and relay data between the sensor nodes and\nremote base station. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the\nAoI and AAV energy consumption, by jointly optimizing the AAV trajectories and\ncommunication schedules. Due to the non-convex nature of the problem and its\npronounced temporal variability, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning\nsolution that incorporates temporal sequence input, layer normalization gated\nrecurrent unit, and a squeeze-and-excitation block to capture long-term\ndependencies, thereby improving decision-making stability and accuracy, and\nreducing computational complexity.

This scheduling problem is a restless\nmulti-armed bandit (RMAB) problem with a non-separable penalty function.

To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as\nBest-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the\nassumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple\nattempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting\neither the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or\nthe most frequently generated query with Maj.

This means testing the expected\noutcomes of probabilistic programs requires repeated test executions unlike\ndeterministic programs where a single execution may suffice for each test\ninput. This raises the following question: how many times should we run a\nprobabilistic program to effectively test it? This work proposes a novel\nblack-box unit testing method, ProbTest, for testing the outcomes of\nprobabilistic programs. Our method is founded on the theory surrounding a\nwell-known combinatorial problem, the coupon collector's problem. Using this\nmethod, developers can write unit tests as usual without extra effort while the\nnumber of required test executions is determined automatically with statistical\nguarantees for the results. We implement ProbTest as a plug-in for PyTest, a\nwell-known unit testing tool for python programs.

It entails two main actions: (i) individuals first feign\nsupport for the entity, and exhibit this allegiance widely; (ii) they then\nengage in offensive or irritating behavior, attempting to undermine the entity\nby association. This deceptive conduct is designed to tarnish the reputation of\nthe target and/or its fan community. Fanchuan is a novel, covert and indirect\nform of social attack, occurring outside the targeted community (often in a\nsimilar or broader community), with strategic long-term objectives. This\ndistinguishes fanchuan from other types of antisocial behavior and presents\nsignificant new challenges in moderation. We argue it is crucial to understand\nand combat this new malicious behavior. Therefore, we conduct the first\nempirical study on fanchuan behavior in livestreaming chats, focusing on\nBilibili, a leading livestreaming platform in China. Our dataset covers 2.7\nmillion livestreaming sessions on Bilibili, featuring 3.6 billion chat\nmessages. We identify 130k instances of fanchuan behavior across 37.4k\nlivestreaming sessions. Through various types of analysis, our research offers\nvaluable insights into fanchuan behavior and its perpetrators."}

Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the\ndynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual\nstimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel\nframework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and\nsemantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper\n(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video\nReconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to\nextract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain\nregions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the\nTDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal\nconsistency between the feature representations and the original neural\nrecordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR\ntranslates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video\nreconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art\n(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by\n12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively.

While recent advances in\nnative agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,\naction, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data\nscalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of\nGUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we\npresent UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these\nchallenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for\nscalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI\nenvironment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox\nplatform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that\nUI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.\nOn GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on\nWindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines\nsuch as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean\nnormalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level\nperformance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,\nOpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to\nlong-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,\nhighlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of\ntraining dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and\nefficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's\npotential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization\nto real-world interactive scenarios."}
