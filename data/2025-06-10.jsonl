Our framework, TERAIO, is developed explicitly for\nlarge language model (LLM) training with multiple GPUs and multiple SSDs. Its\ndesign is driven by our observation that the active tensors take only a small\nfraction (1.7% on average) of allocated GPU memory in each LLM training\niteration, the inactive tensors are usually large and will not be used for a\nlong period of time, creating ample opportunities for offloading/prefetching\ntensors to/from slow SSDs without stalling the GPU training process. TERAIO\naccurately estimates the lifetime (active period of time in GPU memory) of each\ntensor with the profiling of the first few iterations in the training process.\nWith the tensor lifetime analysis, TERAIO will generate an optimized tensor\noffloading/prefetching plan and integrate it into the compiled LLM program via\nPyTorch. TERAIO has a runtime tensor migration engine to execute the\noffloading/prefetching plan via GPUDirect storage, which allows direct tensor\nmigration between GPUs and SSDs for alleviating the CPU bottleneck and\nmaximizing the SSD bandwidth utilization. In comparison with state-of-the-art\nstudies such as ZeRO-Offload and ZeRO-Infinity, we show that TERAIO improves\nthe training performance of various LLMs by 1.47x on average, and achieves\n80.7% of the ideal performance assuming unlimited GPU memory."}

Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite\nrules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance\nregressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query\nrewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite\nrules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques\ncannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts\nexhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and\nreasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL\nqueries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly\napplying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address\nthis issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and\nfeedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into\nsemantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a\nbroader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based\nmethods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite\nstate machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and\nenhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we\ndevelop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate\noptimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection\ntechnique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive\nexperiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over\nstate-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior\nmethods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle."}

To solve this problem, this paper explores the\nintegration of reinforcement learning (RL) within AD to personalize driving\nbehavior and optimally balance occupant comfort and travel efficiency. In\nparticular, we propose an intelligent cruise control framework that adapts to\nvarying driving conditions to enhance infant sleep quality by effectively\nsynergizing wearable sensing and vehicle data. Long short-term memory (LSTM)\nand transformer-based neural networks are integrated with RL to model the\nrelationship between driving behavior and infant sleep quality under diverse\ntraffic and road conditions. Based on the sleep quality indicators from the\nwearable sensors, driving action data from vehicle controllers, and map data\nfrom map applications, the model dynamically computes the optimal driving\naggressiveness level, which is subsequently translated into specific AD control\nstrategies, e.g., the magnitude and frequency of acceleration, lane change, and\novertaking.

However,\nexisting fine-tuning methods suffer from two key issues: underfitting, where\nthe model fails to reliably capture subject identity, and overfitting, where it\nmemorizes the subject image and reduces background diversity. To address these\nchallenges, we propose two auxiliary consistency losses for diffusion\nfine-tuning. First, a prior consistency regularization loss ensures that the\npredicted diffusion noise for prior (non-subject) images remains consistent\nwith that of the pretrained model, improving fidelity. Second, a subject\nconsistency regularization loss enhances the fine-tuned model's robustness to\nmultiplicative noise modulated latent code, helping to preserve subject\nidentity while improving diversity.

To address this gap, we developed\nand validated a new 12-item questionnaire to measure LLM dependency, referred\nto as LLM-D12.

Given a design mock-up and the\nimplementation of its application, GUIPilot reports both their screen\ninconsistencies as well as process inconsistencies. On the one hand, GUIPilot\ndetects the screen inconsistencies by abstracting every screen into a widget\ncontainer where each widget is represented by its position, width, height, and\ntype. By defining the partial order of widgets and the costs of replacing,\ninserting, and deleting widgets in a screen, we convert the screen-matching\nproblem into an optimizable widget alignment problem.

Existing language\nmodels and diffusion-based methods often struggle to balance global coherence\nwith local fidelity, resulting in outputs that lack musicality or suffer from\nincoherent progression and mismatched lyrics. This paper introduces\n$\\textbf{SongBloom}$, a novel framework for full-length song generation that\nleverages an interleaved paradigm of autoregressive sketching and\ndiffusion-based refinement. SongBloom employs an autoregressive diffusion model\nthat combines the high fidelity of diffusion models with the scalability of\nlanguage models.

The interleaved\ngeneration paradigm effectively integrates prior semantic and acoustic context\nto guide the generation process.

Despite its impressive\nalgorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices\nremains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper\npresents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies.\nFirst, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of\ncommon terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve\nthis, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses\nshared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design,\neffectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by\nidentifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process,\nwe introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent\nblending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for\ncostly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to\nimprove its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization\nand neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing\narray that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput.

Despite their prevalence,\nrelatively little is known about the effectiveness of these systems. In this\npaper, we conduct an audit of Twitch's automated moderation tool\n($\\texttt{AutoMod}$) to investigate its effectiveness in flagging hateful\ncontent. For our audit, we create streaming accounts to act as siloed test\nbeds, and interface with the live chat using Twitch's APIs to send over\n$107,000$ comments collated from $4$ datasets. We measure $\\texttt{AutoMod}$'s\naccuracy in flagging blatantly hateful content containing misogyny, racism,\nableism and homophobia. Our experiments reveal that a large fraction of hateful\nmessages, up to $94\\%$ on some datasets, $\\textit{bypass moderation}$.\nContextual addition of slurs to these messages results in $100\\%$ removal,\nrevealing $\\texttt{AutoMod}$'s reliance on slurs as a moderation signal. We\nalso find that contrary to Twitch's community guidelines, $\\texttt{AutoMod}$\nblocks up to $89.5\\%$ of benign examples that use sensitive words in\npedagogical or empowering contexts. Overall, our audit points to large gaps in\n$\\texttt{AutoMod}$'s capabilities and underscores the importance for such\nsystems to understand context effectively."}
