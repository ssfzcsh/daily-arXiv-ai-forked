We propose the Domain-guided\nFine-tuning (DogFit) method, an effective guidance mechanism for diffusion\ntransfer learning that maintains controllability without incurring additional\ncomputational overhead. DogFit injects a domain-aware guidance offset into the\ntraining loss, effectively internalizing the guided behavior during the\nfine-tuning process. The domain-aware design is motivated by our observation\nthat during fine-tuning, the unconditional source model offers a stronger\nmarginal estimate than the target model. To support efficient controllable\nfidelity-diversity trade-offs at inference, we encode the guidance strength\nvalue as an additional model input through a lightweight conditioning\nmechanism. We further investigate the optimal placement and timing of the\nguidance offset during training and propose two simple scheduling strategies,\ni.e., late-start and cut-off, which improve generation quality and training\nstability.

This imbalance arises from\nvariable-length text inputs and varying visual token counts in mixed-resolution\nand image-video joint training. KnapFormer redistributes tokens by first\ngathering sequence length metadata across all ranks in a balancing group and\nsolving a global knapsack problem. The solver aims to minimize the variances of\ntotal workload per-GPU, while accounting for the effect of sequence\nparallelism. By integrating DeepSpeed-Ulysees-based sequence parallelism in the\nload-balancing decision process and utilizing a simple semi-empirical workload\nmodel, KnapFormers achieves minimal communication overhead and less than 1%\nworkload discrepancy in real-world training workloads with sequence length\nvarying from a few hundred to tens of thousands. It eliminates straggler\neffects and achieves 2x to 3x speedup when training state-of-the-art diffusion\nmodels like FLUX on mixed-resolution and image-video joint data corpora.

This gap derives from the textual and uncertain nature of\nLLMs, compounded by concerns on user acceptance of LLM driven body control. To\nbridge this gap and realize the potential of collaborative human-LLM action,\nthis work explores human experience of LLM driven kinesthetic assistance.\nSpecifically, we introduced an \"Align-Analyze-Adjust\" strategy and developed\nFlightAxis, a tool that integrates LLM with Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS)\nfor flight skill acquisition, a representative operational skill domain.\nFlightAxis learns flight skills from manuals and guides forearm movements\nduring simulated flight tasks. Our results demonstrate high user acceptance of\nLLM-mediated body control and significantly reduced task completion times.\nCrucially, trainees reported that this kinesthetic assistance enhanced their\nawareness of operation flaws and fostered increased engagement in the training\nprocess, rather than relieving perceived load. This work demonstrated the\npotential of kinesthetic LLM training in operational skill acquisition."}

In particular, grass-based\ndisplays have drawn attention as landscape-friendly interactive interfaces. To\ndevelop the grass display, it is important to obtain the grass color change\ncharacteristics that depend on the real environment. However, conventional\nmethods require experiments on actual equipment every time the lighting or\nviewpoint changes, which is time-consuming and costly. Although research has\nbegun on simulating grass colors, this approach still faces significant issues\nas it takes many hours for a single measurement. In this paper, we explore an\ninteractive simulation of a grass display color change characteristic based on\nreal-world conditions in a virtual environment. We evaluated our method's\naccuracy by simulating grass color characteristics across multiple viewpoints\nand environments, and then compared the results against prior work. The results\nindicated that our method tended to simulate the grass color characteristics\nsimilar to the actual characteristics and showed the potential to do so more\nquickly and with comparable accuracy to the previous study."}

With the emergence of large language models\n(LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further\nrefined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the\ntraditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures\ndestabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine\nCommunication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second\nsection examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the\nmachine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics\ncontinue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to\npredictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the\nRational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing\non optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the\nissue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and\ncommunicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM\nevaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the\npaper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of\nincreased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding,\nemphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both\nfor the model and themselves. These arguments suggest that pragmatic theory may\nneed to be adjusted or expanded to better account for communication involving\ngenerative AI."}

Building on this framework, we\npresent EICAP-Bench, a novel MCQ style multi-turn benchmark designed to\nevaluate EI capabilities in open-source LLMs across diverse linguistic and\ncultural contexts. We evaluate six LLMs: LLaMA3 (8B), LLaMA3-Instruct, Gemma\n(9B), Gemma-Instruct, Qwen2.5 (7B), and Qwen2.5-Instruct on EmoCap-Bench,\nidentifying Qwen2.5-Instruct as the strongest baseline. To assess the potential\nfor enhancing EI capabilities, we fine-tune both Qwen2.5-Base and\nQwen2.5-Instruct using LoRA adapters on UltraChat (UC), a large-scale,\ninstruction-tuned dialogue dataset, in both English and Arabic.

This study introduces\nEmoAugNet, a hybrid deep learning framework, that incorporates Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) layers with one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks\n(1D-CNN) to enable reliable Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). The quality and\nvariety of the features that are taken from speech signals have a significant\nimpact on how well SER systems perform. A comprehensive speech data\naugmentation strategy was used to combine both traditional methods, such as\nnoise addition, pitch shifting, and time stretching, with a novel\ncombination-based augmentation pipeline to enhance generalization and reduce\noverfitting. Each audio sample was transformed into a high-dimensional feature\nvector using root mean square energy (RMSE), Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficient\n(MFCC), and zero-crossing rate (ZCR). Our model with ReLU activation has a\nweighted accuracy of 95.78\\% and unweighted accuracy of 92.52\\% on the IEMOCAP\ndataset and, with ELU activation, has a weighted accuracy of 96.75\\% and\nunweighted accuracy of 91.28\\%.
