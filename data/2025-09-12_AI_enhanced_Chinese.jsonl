However, obtaining high-quality\nmeshes of engineering microstructures using these approaches remains an open\nquestion. In harmonic approaches, we usually reconstruct surfaces by evaluating\nthe harmonic bases on equidistantly sampled simplicial complexes of the base\ndomains (e.g., triangular spheroids and disks). However, this traditional\nsampling does not account for local changes in the Jacobian of the basis\nfunctions, resulting in nonuniform discretization after reconstruction or\ngeneration.

To create awareness for developers who are implementing LLMs in their\nproducts, there is a strong need to collect more information about the energy\nefficiency of LLMs. While existing research has evaluated the energy efficiency\nof various models, these benchmarks often fall short of representing realistic\nproduction scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the LLM Efficiency Benchmark,\ndesigned to simulate real-world usage conditions.

Traditional\ndisplay measurement methods based on sparse radiometric sampling and fitting a\nmodel are inadequate for capturing spatially varying display artifacts, as they\nfail to capture high-frequency and pixel-level distortions. While cameras offer\nsufficient spatial resolution, they introduce optical, sampling, and\nphotometric distortions. Furthermore, the physical measurement must be combined\nwith a model of a visual system to assess whether the distortions are going to\nbe visible. To enable perceptual assessment of displays, we propose a\ncombination of a camera-based reconstruction pipeline with a visual difference\npredictor, which account for both the inaccuracy of camera measurements and\nvisual difference prediction. The reconstruction pipeline combines HDR image\nstacking, MTF inversion, vignetting correction, geometric undistortion,\nhomography transformation, and color correction, enabling cameras to function\nas precise display measurement instruments.

As both a distinct and critical domain, cyber\nwarfare requires integrating defensive and offensive technologies into coherent\nstrategies.

Due\nto the computationally-intensive nature of variant calling, genomic data are\nincreasingly processed in cloud environments as large amounts of compute and\nstorage resources can be acquired with the pay-as-you-go pricing model. In this\npaper, we address the problem of efficiently executing a variant calling\npipeline for a workload of human genomes on graphics processing unit\n(GPU)-enabled machines. We propose a novel machine learning (ML)-based approach\nfor optimizing the workload execution to minimize the total execution time. Our\napproach encompasses two key techniques: The first technique employs ML to\npredict the execution times of different stages in a variant calling pipeline\nbased on the characteristics of a genome sequence. Using the predicted times,\nthe second technique generates optimal execution plans for the machines by\ndrawing inspiration from the flexible job shop scheduling problem. The plans\nare executed via careful synchronization across different machines. We\nevaluated our approach on a workload of publicly available genome sequences\nusing a testbed with different types of GPU hardware. We observed that our\napproach was effective in predicting the execution times of variant calling\npipeline stages using ML on features such as sequence size, read quality,\npercentage of duplicate reads, and average read length. In addition, our\napproach achieved 2X speedup (on an average) over a greedy approach that also\nused ML for predicting the execution times on the tested workload of sequences.\nFinally, our approach achieved 1.6X speedup (on an average) over a dynamic\napproach that executed the workload based on availability of resources without\nusing any ML-based time predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728GPU\u652f\u6301\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u6267\u884c\u4eba\u7c7b\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u53d8\u4f53\u8c03\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u53d8\u4f53\u8c03\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5177\u6709\u6309\u9700\u4ed8\u8d39\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u4f53\u8c03\u7528\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7075\u6d3b\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8f66\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u6700\u4f18\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u8d2a\u5a6a\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u5e26\u67652\u500d\u548c1.6\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53d8\u4f53\u8c03\u7528\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We establish such global\nabductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash,\nSegoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between\ndeterminacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of\ngranularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones\nhighlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of\ntuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case\nof hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive\nsearch over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are\nmodel-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of\nlearnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical\nstudy on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different\nrecord-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed\nexplanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u56fe\u5b9a\u4e49\u7a81\u51fa\u663e\u793a\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u4e3b\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u590d\u6742\u6027\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u9884\u6d4b\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u6eaf\u56e0\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u5168\u7a7a\u95f4\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728RelBench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Mobile networks' shift from efficiency-first to\nsustainability-aware has motivated this white paper to assert that resilience\nis a primary design goal, alongside sustainability and efficiency, encompassing\ntechnology, architecture, and economics. We promote resilience by analysing\ndependencies between mobile networks and other critical systems, such as\nenergy, transport, and emergency services, and illustrate how cascading\nfailures spread through infrastructures. We formalise resilience using the 3R\nframework: reliability, robustness, resilience. Subsequently, we translate this\ninto measurable capabilities: graceful degradation, situational awareness,\nrapid reconfiguration, and learning-driven improvement and recovery.\n  Architecturally, we promote edge-native and locality-aware designs, open\ninterfaces, and programmability to enable islanded operations, fallback modes,\nand multi-layer diversity (radio, compute, energy, timing). Key enablers\ninclude AI-native control loops with verifiable behaviour, zero-trust security\nrooted in hardware and supply-chain integrity, and networking techniques that\nprioritise critical traffic, time-sensitive flows, and inter-domain\ncoordination.\n  Resilience also has a techno-economic aspect: open platforms and high-quality\ncomplementors generate ecosystem externalities that enhance resilience while\nopening new markets. We identify nine business-model groups and several\npatterns aligned with the 3R objectives, and we outline governance and\nstandardisation.

Task graph\nmodeling provides a structured way to capture such dependencies and serves as\nthe foundation for many system-level design strategies. However, these\nstrategies typically rely on predefined task graphs, while many real-world\napplications lack explicit graphs and exhibit dynamic, data-dependent behavior,\nlimiting the effectiveness of static approaches. To address this, several task\ngraph modeling methods for realistic workloads have been developed. Yet, they\neither rely on implicit techniques that use application-specific features\nwithout producing explicit graphs, or they generate graphs tailored to fixed\nscheduling models, which limits generality. More importantly, they often\noverlook coherence interactions, creating a gap between design assumptions and\nactual runtime behavior. To overcome these limitations, we propose CoTAM, a\nCoherence-Aware Task Graph Modeling framework for realistic workloads that\nconstructs a unified task graph reflecting runtime behavior. CoTAM analyzes the\nimpact of coherence by decoupling its effects from overall execution,\nquantifies its influence through a learned weighting scheme, and infers\ninter-task dependencies for coherence-aware graph generation.

Recent innovations in this\nfield resulted in promising technologies such as Quantum Key Distribution\n(QKD), which enables the generation of unconditionally secure keys,\nestablishing secure communications between remote nodes. Additionally, QKD\nnetworks enable the interconnection of multinode architectures, extending the\npoint-to-point nature of QKD. However, due to the limitations of the current\nstate of technology, the scalability of QKD networks remains a challenge toward\nfeasible implementations. When it comes to long-distance implementations,\ntrusted relay nodes partially solve the distance issue through the forwarding\nof the distributed keys, allowing applications that do not have a direct QKD\nlink to securely share key material. Even though the relay procedure itself has\nbeen extensively studied, the establishment of the relaying node path still\nlacks a solution. This paper proposes an innovative network architecture that\nsolves the challenges of Key Management System (KMS) identification, relay path\ndiscovery, and scalability of QKD networks by integrating Software-Defined\nNetworking (SDN) principles, and establishing high-level virtual KMSs (vKMS) in\neach node and creating a new entity called the Quantum Security Controller\n(QuSeC). The vKMS serves the end-user key requests, managing the multiple KMSs\nwithin the node and abstracting the user from discovering the correct KMS.\nAdditionally, based on the high-level view of the network topology and status,\nthe QuSeC serves the path discovery requests from vKMSs, computing the\nend-to-end (E2E) relay path and applying security policies.

New Users Experiences and Challenges with Secret Management Tools", "categories": ["cs.HC"], "comment": null, "summary": "Software developers face risks of leaking their software secrets, such as API\nkeys or passwords, which can result in significant harm. Secret management\ntools (SMTs), such as HashiCorp Vault Secrets or Infisical, are highly\nrecommended by industry, academia, and security guidelines to manage secrets\nsecurely. SMTs are designed to help developers secure their secrets in a\ncentral location, yet secrets leaks are still commonplace, and developers\nreport difficulty in learning how to setup and use SMTs. While SMTs typically\ncome with publicly available help resources (e.g., tool documentation and\ninterfaces), it is unclear if these actually help developers learn to\neffectively use SMTs. Without usable help resources that onboards developers,\nquick adoption and effective use of SMTs may be unrealistic. In a qualitative\ntwo-step study, we observed 21 new users in person while they used SMTs to\nperform two secret management tasks: secret storage and access, then secret\ninjection.

However, straggling edge nodes (stragglers)\nsignificantly degrade the performance of MEC systems by prolonging computation\nlatency. While coded distributed computing (CDC) as an effective technique is\nwidely adopted to mitigate straggler effects, existing CDC schemes exhibit two\ncritical limitations: (i) They cannot successfully decode the final result\nunless the number of received results reaches a fixed recovery threshold, which\nseriously restricts their flexibility; (ii) They suffer from inherent poles in\ntheir encoding/decoding functions, leading to decoding inaccuracies and\nnumerical instability in the computational results. To address these\nlimitations, this paper proposes an approximated CDC scheme based on\nbarycentric rational interpolation. The proposed CDC scheme offers several\noutstanding advantages. Firstly, it can decode the final result leveraging any\nreturned results from workers. Secondly, it supports computations over both\nfinite and real fields while ensuring numerical stability.

Through queuing-theoretical\nmodels and simulations in NetSquid, we demonstrate the proposed architecture's\nscalability and effectiveness in maintaining high entanglement fidelity,\noffering a practical path forward for modular QDC networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e09\u5c42\u80d6\u6811\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08QDCs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u9762\u4e34\u6280\u672f\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u9700\u8981\u514b\u670d\u7f51\u7edc\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u5c42\u80d6\u6811\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u53f6\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4ea4\u6362\u810a\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u961f\u5217\u8c03\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u91cf\u5b50\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6392\u961f\u7406\u8bba\u548cNetSquid\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8\u7ea0\u7f20\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We formulate the switching interaction as a dynamic game in which\nauthority is embedded directly into the system dynamics, resulting in Nash\nequilibrium(NE)-based strategies rather than ad hoc switching rules. We\nestablish the existence and characterization of NE in the space of pure\ntakeover strategies under stochastic human intent. For the class of\nlinear-quadratic systems, we derive closed-form recursions for takeover\nstrategies and saddle-point value functions, providing analytical insight and\nefficient computation of cooperative takeover policies. We further introduce a\nbimatrix potential game reformulation to address scenarios where human and\nautonomy utilities are not perfectly aligned, yielding a unifying potential\nfunction that preserves tractability while capturing intent deviations. The\nframework is applied to a vehicle trajectory tracking problem, demonstrating\nhow equilibrium takeover strategies adapt across straight and curved path\nsegments. The results highlight the trade-off between human adaptability and\nautonomous efficiency and illustrate the practical benefits of grounding shared\nautonomy in cooperative game theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u81ea\u6cbb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u535a\u5f08\u5efa\u6a21\u534f\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8c\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u81ea\u6cbb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5206\u914d\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u535a\u5f08\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5c06\u6743\u9650\u5d4c\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8c\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u968f\u673a\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7eaf\u7b56\u7565\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u6cbb\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u81ea\u6cbb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered\nin the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,\nsynchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily\non coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,\nlaw enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in\nphysical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit\ncommunication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial\ncoordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and\nadaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative\nonline search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and\nteam members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and\ncoordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by\nmeasuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements\nwithin shared environments.

This paper introduces a precise\ndefinition and a detailed typology of telecommunications AI incidents,\nestablishing them as a distinct category of risk that extends beyond\nconventional cybersecurity and data protection breaches. It argues for their\nrecognition as a distinct regulatory concern. Using India as a case study for\njurisdictions that lack a horizontal AI law, the paper analyzes the country's\nkey digital regulations. The analysis reveals that India's existing legal\ninstruments, including the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the CERT-In Rules, and\nthe Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, focus on cybersecurity and data\nbreaches, creating a significant regulatory gap for AI-specific operational\nincidents, such as performance degradation and algorithmic bias. The paper also\nexamines structural barriers to disclosure and the limitations of existing AI\nincident repositories. Based on these findings, the paper proposes targeted\npolicy recommendations centered on integrating AI incident reporting into\nIndia's existing telecom governance. Key proposals include mandating reporting\nfor high-risk AI failures, designating an existing government body as a nodal\nagency to manage incident data, and developing standardized reporting\nframeworks.
