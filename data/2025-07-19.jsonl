However,\nexisting 3DGS approaches usually generate plausible outputs and face\nsignificant challenges in complex scene reconstruction, manifesting as\nincomplete holistic structural outlines and unclear local lighting effects. To\naddress these issues simultaneously, we propose a novel decoupled optimization\nframework, which integrates wavelet decomposition into 3D Gaussian Splatting\nand 2D sampling. Technically, through 3D wavelet decomposition, our approach\ndivides point clouds into high-frequency and low-frequency components, enabling\ntargeted optimization for each. The low-frequency component captures global\nstructural outlines and manages the distribution of Gaussians through\nvoxelization. In contrast, the high-frequency component restores intricate\ngeometric and textural details while incorporating a relight module to mitigate\nlighting artifacts and enhance photorealistic rendering. Additionally, a 2D\nwavelet decomposition is applied to the training images, simulating radiance\nvariations. This provides critical guidance for high-frequency detail\nreconstruction, ensuring seamless integration of details with the global\nstructure.

To counter the problems posed by a large (or\ninfinite) set of possible tests, randomization is a natural choice. We study\nthe impact that randomization in conjunction with SLD resolution have on the\ntest performance. To this end, this paper proposes two strategies to add\nrandomization to a test-generating program. One strategy works on top of\nstandard Prolog semantics, whereas the other alters the SLD selection function.\nWe analyze the mean time to reach a test-case, and the mean number of generated\ntest-cases in the framework of Markov chains. Finally, we provide an additional\nempirical evaluation and comparison between both approaches. Under\nconsideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)."}

To enable effective\nvisualization on local, low-end machines, recent advances in view synthesis\ntechniques, such as neural radiance fields, utilize neural networks to generate\nnovel visualizations for volumetric scenes. However, these methods focus on\nreconstruction quality rather than facilitating interactive visualization\nexploration, such as feature extraction and tracking. We introduce VolSegGS, a\nnovel Gaussian splatting framework that supports interactive segmentation and\ntracking in dynamic volumetric scenes for exploratory visualization and\nanalysis. Our approach utilizes deformable 3D Gaussians to represent a dynamic\nvolumetric scene, allowing for real-time novel view synthesis. For accurate\nsegmentation, we leverage the view-independent colors of Gaussians for\ncoarse-level segmentation and refine the results with an affinity field network\nfor fine-level segmentation. Additionally, by embedding segmentation results\nwithin the Gaussians, we ensure that their deformation enables continuous\ntracking of segmented regions over time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nVolSegGS with several time-varying datasets and compare our solutions against\nstate-of-the-art methods. With the ability to interact with a dynamic scene in\nreal time and provide flexible segmentation and tracking capabilities, VolSegGS\noffers a powerful solution under low computational demands. This framework\nunlocks exciting new possibilities for time-varying volumetric data analysis\nand visualization."}

Software Engineering courses are typically\nintroduced later in the curriculum, and can generally allocate only limited\ntime to quality-related topics, leaving educators with the challenge of\ndeciding which quality aspects to prioritize. In this decision, the literature\noffers limited guidance, as most existing studies focus on code written by\nnovice students and small code units, making it unclear whether those findings\nextend to intermediate-level students with foundational object-oriented\nprogramming skills working on more complex software projects. To address this\ngap, we analyze 83 object-oriented team projects developed by 172 university\nstudents across 4 different editions of the Object-Oriented Programming course.\nWe apply a static analysis pipeline used in prior research to assess software\nquality, combining SonarQube and ArchUnit to detect code smells and\narchitectural anti-patterns.

However, interpretability remains a significant limitation for their\napplication in sensitive fields such as affective computing and cognitive\nmodeling. In this work, we introduce a post-hoc interpretability framework\ntailored to dual-stream EEG classifiers, extending the Local Interpretable\nModel-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) approach to accommodate structured,\nbi-hemispheric inputs. Our method adapts LIME to handle structured two-branch\ninputs corresponding to left and right-hemisphere EEG channel groups. It\ndecomposes prediction relevance into per-channel contributions across\nhemispheres and emotional classes. We apply this framework to a previously\nvalidated dual-branch recurrent neural network trained on EmoNeuroDB, a dataset\nof EEG recordings captured during a VR-based emotion elicitation task. The\nresulting explanations reveal emotion-specific hemispheric activation patterns\nconsistent with known neurophysiological phenomena, such as frontal\nlateralization in joy and posterior asymmetry in sadness. Furthermore, we\naggregate local explanations across samples to derive global channel importance\nprofiles, enabling a neurophysiologically grounded interpretation of the\nmodel's decisions. Correlation analysis between symmetric electrodes further\nhighlights the model's emotion-dependent lateralization behavior, supporting\nthe functional asymmetries reported in affective neuroscience."}

The CCAI license offers\nsignificant advantages, including enhanced developer control, incentivization\nof open source AI development, and mitigation of openwashing practices. This is\ndemonstrated through a structured three-part evaluation framework that examines\n(1) legal feasibility under current copyright law, (2) policy justification\ncomparing traditional software and AI contexts, and (3) synthesis of\ncross-contextual benefits and risks. However, the increased risk profile of\nopen source AI, particularly the potential for direct misuse, necessitates\ncomplementary regulatory approaches to achieve an appropriate risk-benefit\nbalance. The paper concludes that when implemented within a robust regulatory\nenvironment focused on responsible AI usage, the CCAI license provides a viable\nmechanism for preserving and adapting core FOSS principles to the evolving\nlandscape of generative AI development."}

We aim to develop a robust, scalable model that\ndistinguishes termite generated acoustic signals from background noise. We\nintroduce a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network Long Short Term Memory\narchitecture that captures both spatial and temporal features of termite\nactivity.

Experimental results show high performance,\nwith 94.5% accuracy, 93.2% precision, and 95.8% recall. Comparative analysis\nreveals that the hybrid model outperforms standalone CNN and LSTM\narchitectures, underscoring its combined strength.

However, it is highly\nsusceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which\nlead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG\nlearning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer\nknowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models.\nNevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label\nmisalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual\nfeature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create\ndiscrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper\naddresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined\nlabels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that\nmitigates both modality and label inconsistencies. It aligns feature semantics\nthrough a prototype-based similarity module and introduces a task-specific\ndistillation head to resolve label-induced inconsistency in supervision.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our approach improves EEG-based emotion\nregression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and\nmultimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset. These findings highlight\nthe potential of our framework for BCI applications."}
