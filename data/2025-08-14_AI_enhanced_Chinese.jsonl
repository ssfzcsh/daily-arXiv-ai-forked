Existing log parsers can be categorized into\nstatistic-based and semantic-based approaches. In comparison to semantic-based\nparsers, existing statistic-based parsers tend to be more efficient, require\nlower computational costs, and be more privacy-preserving thanks to on-premise\ndeployment, but often fall short in their accuracy (e.g., grouping or parsing\naccuracy) and generalizability. Therefore, it became a common belief that\nstatistic-based parsers cannot be as effective as semantic-based parsers since\nthe latter could take advantage of external knowledge supported by pretrained\nlanguage models. Our work, however, challenges this belief with a novel\nstatistic-based parser, PIPLUP. PIPLUP eliminates the pre-assumption of the\nposition of constant tokens for log grouping and relies on data-insensitive\nparameters to overcome the generalizability challenge, allowing \"plug and play\"\non given log files. According to our experiments on an open-sourced large log\ndataset, PIPLUP shows promising accuracy and generalizability with the\ndata-insensitive default parameter set. PIPLUP not only outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art statistic-based log parsers, Drain and its variants, but also\nobtains a competitive performance compared to the best unsupervised\nsemantic-based log parser (i.e., LUNAR).

The\nfirst stage focuses on intent inference, where the model analyzes the code\npreceding the target function to uncover cues about the desired functionality.\nSuch preceding context often encodes subtle but critical information, and we\ndesign a reasoning-based prompting framework to guide the LLM through\nstep-by-step extraction and synthesis of these signals before any code is\ngenerated. The second stage introduces an optional interactive refinement\nmechanism to handle cases where preceding context alone is insufficient for\nintent recovery. In this stage, the model proposes a small set of candidate\nintentions, enabling the developer to select or edit them so that the inferred\nintent closely matches the actual requirement. Finally, in the third stage, the\nLLM generates the target function conditioned on the finalized intent. To\nsupport this pipeline, we curate a dataset of 40,000 examples annotated with\nintermediate reasoning traces and corresponding docstrings.

A tensor field assigns a tensor - a\nmulti-dimensional array of numbers - to each point in space. Tensor fields,\nsuch as the stress and strain tensors, and the Riemann curvature tensor, are\nessential to both science and engineering. The topology of tensor fields\ncaptures the core structure of data, and is useful in various disciplines, such\nas graphics (for manipulating shapes and textures) and neuroscience (for\nanalyzing brain structures from diffusion MRI). Lossy data compression may\ndistort the topology of tensor fields, thus hindering downstream analysis and\nvisualization tasks. TFZ ensures that certain topological features are\npreserved during lossy compression. Specifically, TFZ preserves degenerate\npoints essential to the topology of symmetric tensor fields and retains\neigenvector and eigenvalue graphs that represent the topology of asymmetric\ntensor fields.

The process of code review is highly inefficient\nfor several reasons, such as it being a time-consuming process, inconsistent\nfeedback, and review quality not being at par most of the time. Using our\ntelemetry data, we observed that at TATA 1mg, pull request (PR) processing\nexhibits significant inefficiencies, with average pick-up and review times of\n73 and 82 hours, respectively, resulting in a 6.2 day closure cycle. The review\ncycle was marked by prolonged iterative communication between the reviewing and\nsubmitting parties. Research from the University of California, Irvine\nindicates that interruptions can lead to an average of 23 minutes of lost\nfocus, critically affecting code quality and timely delivery. To address these\nchallenges, we developed DeputyDev's PR review capabilities by providing\nautomated, contextual code reviews. We conducted a rigorous double-controlled\nA/B experiment involving over 200 engineers to evaluate DeputyDev's impact on\nreview times. The results demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in\nboth average per PR (23.09%) and average per-line-of-code (40.13%) review\ndurations. After implementing safeguards to exclude outliers, DeputyDev has\nbeen effectively rolled out across the entire organisation. Additionally, it\nhas been made available to external companies as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)\nsolution, currently supporting the daily work of numerous engineering\nprofessionals.

They\nare suboptimal in extremely dynamic vehicular environments because they are\nconstrained to static optimization objectives and base their decisions on the\ncurrent network states. This paper presents a novel Semantic-Aware Proactive\nLLM Orchestration (SP-LLM) framework to address these issues. Our method\ntransforms the traditional Digital Twin (DT) into a Predictive Digital Twin\n(pDT) that predicts important network parameters such as task arrivals, vehicle\nmobility, and channel quality. A Large Language Model (LLM) that serves as a\ncognitive orchestrator is at the heart of our framework. It makes proactive,\nforward-looking decisions about task offloading and resource allocation by\nutilizing the pDT's forecasts.

Our\npipeline consists of three key modules: a raylet feature extractor, a raylet\ndistance field predictor, and a multi-raylet blender.

In AI-based systems, notations are implicitly defined by the data\nused to train these systems. In order to create usable and intuitive notations\nfor interactive design systems, we must regard, design, and evaluate these\ntraining datasets as notation specifications. To better understand the design\nspace of notational possibilities for future design tools, we use the Cognitive\nDimensions of Notations framework to analyze two possible notations for UI\nsketching. The first notation is the sketching rules for an existing UI sketch\ndataset, and the second notation is the set of sketches generated by\nparticipants in this study, where individuals sketched UIs without imposed\nrepresentational rules. We imagine two systems, FixedSketch and FlexiSketch,\nbuilt with each notation respectively, in order to understand the differential\naffordances of, and potential design requirements for, systems. We find that\nparticipants' sketches were composed of element-level notations that are\nambiguous in isolation but are interpretable in context within whole designs.\nFor many cognitive dimensions, the FlexiSketch notation supports greater\nintuitive creative expression and affords lower cognitive effort than the\nFixedSketch notation, but cannot be supported with prevailing, element-based\napproaches to UI sketch recognition. We argue that for future multimodal design\ntools to be truly human-centered, they must adopt contemporary AI methods,\nincluding transformer-based and human-in-the-loop, reinforcement learning\ntechniques to understand users' context-rich expressive notations and\ncorrections.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001UI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cdUI\u8349\u56fe\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u4eba\u6027\u5316\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u9700\u91c7\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u7684AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u76f4\u89c2\u6613\u7528\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c6\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9UI\u8349\u56fe\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\"\u7b26\u53f7\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ef4\u5ea6\"\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cdUI\u8349\u56fe\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u89c4\u5219\u7b26\u53f7\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u81ea\u7531\u7ed8\u5236\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u7b26\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7ed8\u5236\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u7b26\u53f7\u5728\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u6a21\u7cca\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\"FlexiSketch\"\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u9ad8\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u521b\u9020\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u548c\u4eba\u5728\u73af\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u3002"}}

While this approach is well established in tabular settings,\nextending it to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) poses challenges due to the\ncontinuous nature of the state-action space, the noisy approximations of neural\nnetworks, and the impracticality of storing all past models for reuse. In this\nwork, we address these challenges and introduce DQInit, a method that adapts\nvalue function initialization to DRL. DQInit reuses compact tabular Q-values\nextracted from previously solved tasks as a transferable knowledge base.

While a growing\nbody of CSCW research centered on the future of work has begun to document\nthese shifts, relatively little is known about workers' experiences beyond\nthose of platform-mediated gig workers. In this paper, we turn to a traditional\nwork sector, Amazon fulfillment centers (FC), to deepen our field's empirical\nexamination of algorithmic management. Drawing on two years of ethnographic\nresearch, we show how FC workers react to managers' interventions, imposed\nproductivity rates, and quantified objectification when subjected to\nlabor-tracking systems in their physical work environments. Situating FC\nworkers' resistance to algorithmic systems and metrics within the current CSCW\nliterature allows us to explicate and link the nuanced practices of FC workers\nto the larger discourse of algorithmic control mechanisms. In addition, we show\nhow FC workers' resistance practices are emblematic of 'work games'--a\nlong-studied means by which workers agentically configure (\"trick\") their\nengagement within work systems. We argue that gaining a more nuanced\nunderstanding of workers' resistance and consent in relation to algorithmic\nmanagement expands our ability to critique and potentially disassemble the\neconomic and political forces at the root of these sociotechnical labor\nsystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u7269\u6d41\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5de5\u4eba\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u53ca\u5176\u62b5\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u4f20\u7edf\u884c\u4e1a\u5de5\u4eba\uff08\u975e\u5e73\u53f0\u96f6\u5de5\uff09\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0b\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ee5\u8865\u5145CSCW\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u5e74\u7684\u6c11\u65cf\u5fd7\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7269\u6d41\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5de5\u4eba\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u2018\u5de5\u4f5c\u6e38\u620f\u2019\uff08work games\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u6839\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u89e3\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u4e0e\u540c\u610f\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6279\u5224\u5e76\u89e3\u6784\u7b97\u6cd5\u52b3\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u529b\u91cf\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel distributed algorithm that allows a group of modules to reconfigure into\na diamond shape, starting from an arbitrary side-connected configuration. It is\nconnectivity-preserving and operates under minimal assumptions: one leader\nmodule, common chirality, constant memory per module, and visibility and\ncommunication restricted to immediate neighbors. Unlike prior work, which\nrelaxes the original sliding square move-set, our approach uses the unmodified\nmove-set, addressing the additional challenge of handling locked\nconfigurations.

Combining ergonomic layout design with body-centric input\nand passive haptics, Handows supports four core operations: window selection,\nclosure, positioning, and scaling. We evaluate Handows in a user study (N=15)\nagainst two common VR techniques (virtual hand and controller) across these\ncore window operations.

By treating explanation as a sociotechnical\ndesign process, this framework encourages a context-aware approach to XAI that\nsupports effective communication and the development of ethically responsible\nexplanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u8003\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201cWho, What, How\u201d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u601d\u7ef4\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u8003\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u7684XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6709\u6548\u4ea4\u6d41\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u8d23\u4efb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u89e3\u91ca\u89c6\u4e3a\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u548c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684XAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

In this paper, we\nstart from the observation that constrained IoT devices have largely different\nhardware (im-)balances than full-scale machines. We find that the performance\ngap between MCU and network throughput on constrained devices enables minimal\nenergy delay product (EDP) for IoT networking at largely reduced clock\nfrequencies. We analyze the potentials by integrating dynamic voltage and\nfrequency scaling (DVFS) into the RIOT IoT operating system and show that the\nDVFS reconfiguration overhead stays below the energy saved for a single,\ndownscaled MAC operation. Backed by these findings, we systematically\ninvestigate how DVFS further improves energy-efficiency for common networking\ntasks -- in addition to duty-cycling. We measure IoT communication scenarios\nbetween real-world systems and analyze two MAC operating modes -- CSMA/CA and\ntime slotting -- in combination with different CoAP transactions, payload\nsizes, as well as DTLS transport encryption. Our experiments reveal energy\nsavings between 24% and 52% for MAC operations and up to 37% for encrypted CoAP\ncommunication.

Copyright to IEEE may be transferred without notice", "summary": "Starlink delivers Internet services to users across terrestrial, maritime,\nand aviation domains. The prior works have studied its performance at fixed\nsites and in-motion vehicles, while an in-depth analysis of in-flight\nperformance remains absent. With major airlines now offering Starlink Internet\nonboard, there is a growing need to evaluate and improve its performance for\naviation users. This paper addresses this shortcoming by conducting in-flight\nmeasurements over the Baltic Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Our measurement results\nshow that a single user device experiences median throughputs of 64 Mbps and 24\nMbps for the downlink and uplink, respectively. The median uplink throughput is\napproximately 33 Mbps when the aircraft maintains an altitude above 17,000\nfeet. However, a significant reduction in uplink performance is observed during\nthe aircraft descent phase, with the median throughput dropping to around 20\nMbps at lower altitudes.

Among the various V2X\napplications, platooning is one of the most promising ones, as it allows a\ngroup of vehicles to travel closely together at high speeds, reducing fuel\nconsumption and emissions. However, it poses significant challenges for\nwireless communication, such as high reliability and low latency. In this\npaper, we evaluate the benefits of group scheduling, also referred to as Mode\n2d, which is based on a distributed and scheduled resource allocation scheme\nthat allows the group of cars to select resources from a configured pool\nwithout network assistance.
