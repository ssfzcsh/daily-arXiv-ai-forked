However, current benchmarks fall short in\nevaluating such production-ready software, as they often rely on static checks\nor binary pass/fail scripts, failing to capture the interactive behaviors and\nruntime dynamics that define real-world usability - qualities that only emerge\nwhen an application is actively used. This is the blind spot of current\nevaluation: you don't know if an app works until you click through it, interact\nwith it, and observe how it responds. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nRealDevWorld, a novel evaluation framework for automated end-to-end assessment\nof LLMs' ability to generate production-ready repositories from scratch. It\nfeatures two key components: (1) RealDevBench, a diverse collection of 194\nopen-ended software engineering tasks across multiple domains, incorporating\nmultimodal elements to reflect real-world complexity; and (2) AppEvalPilot, a\nnew agent-as-a-judge evaluation system that simulates realistic, GUI-based user\ninteractions to automatically and holistically assess software functional\ncorrectness, visual fidelity, and runtime behavior. The framework delivers\nfine-grained, task-specific diagnostic feedback, supporting nuanced evaluation\nbeyond simple success/failure judgments. Empirical results show that\nRealDevWorld delivers effective, automatic, and human-aligned evaluations,\nachieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a correlation of 0.85 with expert human\nassessments, while significantly reducing the reliance on manual review.

The standard way that PBT users\ngenerate test inputs is via generators that describe how to sample test inputs\nthrough random choices. To achieve a good distribution over test inputs, users\nmust tune their generators, i.e., decide on the weights of these individual\nrandom choices. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to understand how to choose\nindividual generator weights in order to achieve a desired distribution, so\ntoday this process is tedious and limits the distributions that can be\npractically achieved.\n  In this paper, we develop techniques for the automatic and offline tuning of\ngenerators. Given a generator with undetermined symbolic weights and an\nobjective function, our approach automatically learns values for these weights\nthat optimize for the objective. We describe useful objective functions that\nallow users to (1) target desired distributions and (2) improve the diversity\nand validity of their test cases.

Most existing live video analytics (LVA) systems, however, have\nbeen built over terrestrial networks, limiting their applications during\nnatural disasters and in remote areas that desperately call for real-time\nvisual data delivery and scene analysis. With the recent advent of space\nnetworking, in particular, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations such\nas Starlink, high-speed truly global Internet access is becoming available and\naffordable. This paper examines the challenges and potentials of LVA over\nmodern LEO satellite networking (LSN). Using Starlink as the testbed, we have\ncarried out extensive in-the-wild measurements to gain insights into its\nachievable performance for LVA. The results reveal that the uplink bottleneck\nin today's LSN, together with the volatile network conditions, can\nsignificantly affect the service quality of LVA and necessitate prompt\nadaptation.

To overcome these obstacles,\ninnovative approaches are required. Agile chip design has already benefited\nfrom machine learning integration at various stages, including logic synthesis,\nplacement, and routing. With Large Language Models (LLMs) recently\ndemonstrating impressive proficiency in Hardware Description Language (HDL)\ngeneration, it is promising to extend their abilities to 2.5D integration, an\nadvanced technique that saves area overhead and development costs. However,\nLLM-driven chiplet design faces challenges such as flatten design, high\nvalidation cost and imprecise parameter optimization, which limit its chiplet\ndesign capability.

These components\ntogether enhance the efficient generation of chiplet design with optimized\nPower, Performance and Area (PPA).

We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs\ncapable of synthesizing intricate geometries.

As a result, the \"core\" of the deadlock can\nbe obfuscated by its consequences on the rest of the system, and diagnosing and\nfixing the problem can be challenging.\n  In this work we tackle the challenge by proposing distributed black-box\nmonitors that are deployed alongside each service and detect deadlocks by only\nobserving the incoming and outgoing messages, and exchanging probes with other\nmonitors. We present a formal model that captures popular RPC-based application\nstyles (e.g., gen_servers in Erlang/OTP), and a distributed black-box\nmonitoring algorithm that we prove sound and complete (i.e., identifies\ndeadlocked services with neither false positives nor false negatives). We\nimplement our results in a tool called DDMon for the monitoring of Erlang/OTP\napplications, and we evaluate its performance.\n  This is the first work that formalises, proves the correctness, and\nimplements distributed black-box monitors for deadlock detection.

A promising quantum error-correcting code for\nlarge-scale quantum computing is the surface code. For this code,\nFault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) can be performed via lattice surgery,\ni.e. merging and splitting of encoded qubit patches on a 2D grid. Lattice\nsurgery operations result in space-time patterns of activity that are defined\nin this work as access traces. This work demonstrates that the access traces\nreveal when, where, and how logical qubits interact. Leveraging this\nformulation, this work further introduces TraceQ, a trace-based reconstruction\nframework that is able to reconstruct the quantum circuit dataflow just by\nobserving the patch activity at each trace entry. The framework is supported by\nheuristics for handling inherent ambiguity in the traces, and demonstrates its\neffectiveness on a range of synthetic fault-tolerant quantum benchmarks. The\naccess traces can have applications in a wide range of scenarios, enabling\nanalysis and profiling of execution of quantum programs and the hardware they\nrun on. As one example use of TraceQ, this work investigates whether such\ntraces can act as a side channel through which an observer can recover the\ncircuit's structure and identify known subroutines in a larger program or even\nwhole programs. The findings show that indeed the minimal access traces can be\nused to recover subroutines or even whole quantum programs with very high\naccuracy. Only a single trace per program execution is needed and the\nprocessing can be done fully offline.

Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive\nverification by orchestrating two components: (i) potential runtime error\n(RTE)-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii)\nLLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We\nenvisage that Preguss paves a compelling path towards the automated\nverification of large-scale programs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Preguss\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6f14\u7ece\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u56e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9650\u5236\u548c\u590d\u6742\u89c4\u8303\u63a8\u65ad\u56f0\u96be\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "Preguss\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6f14\u7ece\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RTE\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5355\u5143\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u5355\u5143\u7ea7\u89c4\u8303\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "Preguss\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7a0b\u5e8f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "Preguss\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

To address this dilemma, we\ncontribute the first-of-its-kind fine-grained image quality assessment dataset\nfor image restoration, termed FGRestore, comprising 18,408 restored images\nacross six common IR tasks.

Sharding is considered a\npromising solution to enhance blockchain scalability. However, most existing\nblockchain sharding techniques prioritize performance at the cost of\navailability (e.g., a failure in a few servers holding a shard leads to data\nunavailability). In this paper, we propose PyloChain, a hierarchical sharded\nblockchain that balances availability and performance. PyloChain consists of\nmultiple lower-level local chains and one higher-level main chain. Each local\nchain speculatively executes local transactions to achieve high parallelism\nacross multiple local chains. The main chain leverages a directed-acyclic-graph\n(DAG)-based mempool to guarantee local block availability and to enable\nefficient Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus to execute global (or\ncross-shard) transactions within a collocated sharding. PyloChain speculatively\nexecutes local transactions across multiple local chains to achieve high\nparallelism. In order to reduce the number of aborted local transactions,\nPyloChain applies a simple scheduling technique to handle global transactions\nin the main chain. PyloChain provides a fine-grained auditing mechanism to\nmitigate faulty higher-level members by externalizing main chain operations to\nlower-level local members.

These sensory-rich modalities are beyond\nthe scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present\nShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data\nscarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text\nand 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and\nphysiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to\nachieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect\nrecent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for\nMedicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that\nShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger\nproprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among\nexisting multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities\nlike sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal\nperception and diagnosis in TCM.

To address this challenge, we present an\napproach that considers the components' input and output data flows as a source\nfor representing the behavior and provide explanations for the components,\nenabling users to comprehend what happened. In the QA framework used here, the\ndata flows of the components are represented as SPARQL queries (inputs) and RDF\ntriples (outputs). Hence, we are also providing valuable insights on\nverbalization regarding these data types. In our experiments, the approach\ngenerates explanations while following template-based settings (baseline) or\nvia the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) with different configurations\n(automatic generation). Our evaluation shows that the explanations generated\nvia LLMs achieve high quality and mostly outperform template-based approaches\naccording to the users' ratings.

In this paper, we consider a more general and popular\napproach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN\noutput into fact predictions.

The graph captures the topological\ndistribution of histogram extrema. By extracting prominent structure within\nthis graph and projecting each grid point in histogram space onto it, we reduce\nthe dimensionality to one, producing a unified volume.

After engineers identify a bug-triggering test case in\nsimulation-based hardware verification, they usually spend considerable time\nanalyzing the execution trace to localize the bug. Although numerous automated\nhardware debugging techniques exist, they are not applicable to large designs\nand deep bugs. A primary reason for their limitations is that these techniques\nonly utilize the information of a single bug-triggering test case for bug\nlocalization, which prevents them from effectively analyzing intricate hardware\nsystems and figure out the root cause of bugs. To solve this problem, in this\npaper, we transform the hardware bug localization problem into a test\ngeneration problem, aiming to find a set of effective witness test cases beyond\nthe initial bug-triggering test case to enhance hardware bug localization.\nWitness test cases refer to the cases that do not trigger the bug in the faulty\ndesign. By analyzing the execution differences between passing and failing test\ncases with spectrum-based method, we can eliminate innocent design statements\nand localize the buggy ones.

While prior\nresearch has assessed the functional performance of LLM-generated code, this\nresearch tested LLM output from 4,442 Java coding assignments through\ncomprehensive static analysis using SonarQube. The findings suggest that\nalthough LLMs can generate functional code, they also introduce a range of\nsoftware defects, including bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.\nThese defects do not appear to be isolated; rather, they may represent shared\nweaknesses stemming from systemic limitations within current LLM code\ngeneration methods. In particular, critically severe issues, such as hard-coded\npasswords and path traversal vulnerabilities, were observed across multiple\nmodels. These results indicate that LLM-generated code requires verification in\norder to be considered production-ready. This study found no direct correlation\nbetween a model's functional performance (measured by Pass@1 rate of unit\ntests) and the overall quality and security of its generated code, measured by\nthe number of SonarQube issues in benchmark solutions that passed the\nfunctional tests. This suggests that functional benchmark performance score is\nnot a good indicator of overall code quality and security. The goal of this\nstudy is not to rank LLM performance but to highlight that all evaluated models\nappear to share certain weaknesses.

Through extensive experimentation, we\ndemonstrate SNAX's efficiency and flexibility in a low-power heterogeneous SoC.\nAccelerators can easily be integrated and programmed to achieve > 10x\nimprovement in neural network performance compared to other accelerator systems\nwhile maintaining accelerator utilization of > 90% in full system operation.", "AI": {"tldr": "SNAX\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u786c\u4ef6-\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8026\u5408\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u6548\u7387\u548c\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5f02\u6784\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6613\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "SNAX\u7ed3\u5408\u677e\u6563\u8026\u5408\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eMLIR\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u591a\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u96c6\u7fa4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSNAX\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u5f02\u6784SoC\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86>10\u500d\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4fdd\u6301\u5728>90%\u3002", "conclusion": "SNAX\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u786c\u4ef6-\u8f6f\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u6574\u5408\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

This\nshift is driven by the emergence of agentic AI, autonomous systems capable of\nproactive, goal-directed action. However, the field lacks a robust conceptual\nframework to understand, design, and evaluate this new paradigm of human-AI\ninteraction in learning. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel\nconceptual framework (the APCP framework) that charts the transition from AI as\na tool to AI as a collaborative partner. We present a four-level model of\nescalating AI agency within human-AI collaborative learning: (1) the AI as an\nAdaptive Instrument, (2) the AI as a Proactive Assistant, (3) the AI as a\nCo-Learner, and (4) the AI as a Peer Collaborator. Grounded in sociocultural\ntheories of learning and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), this\nframework provides a structured vocabulary for analysing the shifting roles and\nresponsibilities between human and AI agents.

A live camera system, combined with deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL), monitors the network by detecting sensor LED indicators and\nevaluating real-time coverage.

This paper\npresents a novel method using reinforcement learning-based cluster-head\nselection and a hybrid multi-hop routing algorithm, which leverages Q-learning\nwithin a multi-agent system to dynamically adapt transmission paths based on\nthe energy distribution across sensor nodes. Each sensor node is modeled as an\nautonomous agent that observes local state parameters, such as residual energy,\ndistance to sink, hop count, and hotspot proximity, and selects routing actions\nthat maximize long-term energy efficiency. After computing the optimal paths,\neach sensor aggregates sensed data and forwards it through intermediate nodes\nto a selected transmitter node, chosen based on the highest remaining State of\nCharge (SoC), thereby avoiding premature node depletion. To promote efficient\nlearning, a carefully designed reward function incentivizes balanced load\ndistribution, hotspot avoidance, and energy-aware forwarding while maintaining\nsignal quality. The learning process occurs either in a decentralized manner or\nvia a cloud-based controller that offloads computation in large-scale\ndeployments. Moreover, the RL-driven routing decisions are fused with classical\ngraph-based methods, Minimum Energy Routing Algorithm (MERA) and Minimum\nSpanning Tree (MST), to optimize energy consumption and load balancing.\nSimulations confirm that the proposed approach significantly improves node\nsurvival rate, reduces SoC variance, and enhances network resilience, making it\na scalable and adaptive solution for energy-constrained WSNs in dynamic sensor\ndeployments and IoT applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7c07\u5934\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u591a\u8df3\u8def\u7531\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Q\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f20\u8f93\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5ef6\u957f\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408Q\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u878d\u5408MERA\u548cMST\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8282\u70b9\u5b58\u6d3b\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86SoC\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u97e7\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent works,\nsuch as ChatAFL, have integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide protocol\nfuzzing and address these limitations, pushing protocol fuzzers to wider\nexploration of the protocol state space. But ChatAFL still faces issues like\nunreliable output, LLM hallucinations, and assumptions of LLM knowledge about\nprotocol specifications. This paper introduces MultiFuzz, a novel dense\nretrieval-based multi-agent system designed to overcome these limitations by\nintegrating semantic-aware context retrieval, specialized agents, and\nstructured tool-assisted reasoning. MultiFuzz utilizes agentic chunks of\nprotocol documentation (RFC Documents) to build embeddings in a vector database\nfor a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling agents to\ngenerate more reliable and structured outputs, enhancing the fuzzer in mutating\nprotocol messages with enhanced state coverage and adherence to syntactic\nconstraints. The framework decomposes the fuzzing process into modular groups\nof agents that collaborate through chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically\nadapt fuzzing strategies based on the retrieved contextual knowledge.\nExperimental evaluations on the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) demonstrate\nthat MultiFuzz significantly improves branch coverage and explores deeper\nprotocol states and transitions over state-of-the-art (SOTA) fuzzers such as\nNSFuzz, AFLNet, and ChatAFL.

To be published at the IEEE Workshop on Topological Data\n  Analysis and Visualization (TopoInVis) in conjunction with IEEE VIS 2025,\n  Vienna, Austria", "summary": "Many scientific and engineering problems are modelled by simulating scalar\nfields defined either on space-filling meshes (Eulerian) or as particles\n(Lagrangian). For analysis and visualization, topological primitives such as\ncontour trees can be used, but these often need simplification to filter out\nsmall-scale features. For parcel-based convective cloud simulations,\nsimplification of the contour tree requires a volumetric measure rather than\npersistence. Unlike for cubic meshes, volume cannot be approximated by counting\nregular vertices. Typically, this is addressed by resampling irregular data\nonto a uniform grid. Unfortunately, the spatial proximity of parcels requires a\nhigh sampling frequency, resulting in a massive increase in data size for\nprocessing. We therefore extend volume-based contour tree simplification to\nparcel-in-cell simulations with a graph adaptor in Viskores (VTK-m), using\nDelaunay tetrahedralization of the parcel centroids as input.

Data heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in FL, which can result in\npoor convergence and performance degradation. Client drift has been recognized\nas one of the factors contributing to this issue resulting from the multiple\nlocal updates in FedAvg. However, in cross-device FL, a different form of drift\narises due to the partial client participation, but it has not been studied\nwell. This drift, we referred as period drift, occurs as participating clients\nat each communication round may exhibit distinct data distribution that\ndeviates from that of all clients. It could be more harmful than client drift\nsince the optimization objective shifts with every round.\n  In this paper, we investigate the interaction between period drift and client\ndrift, finding that period drift can have a particularly detrimental effect on\ncross-device FL as the degree of data heterogeneity increases.

However, existing\nmethods employ complex selective knowledge-sharing strategies that require\nclients to identify in-distribution proxy data through computationally\nexpensive statistical density ratio estimators. Additionally, server-side\nfiltering of ambiguous knowledge introduces latency to the process. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a robust, resource-efficient EdgeFD method that\nreduces the complexity of the client-side density ratio estimation and removes\nthe need for server-side filtering. EdgeFD introduces an efficient KMeans-based\ndensity ratio estimator for effectively filtering both in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution proxy data on clients, significantly improving the quality\nof knowledge sharing. We evaluate EdgeFD across diverse practical scenarios,\nincluding strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID data distributions on clients,\nwithout requiring a pre-trained teacher model on the server for knowledge\ndistillation. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeFD outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving accuracy levels close to IID\nscenarios even under heterogeneous and challenging conditions.
