However, this\nreliance on untrusted user input introduces a novel and underexplored attack\nsurface. In this paper, we investigate the security risks posed by adversarial\nbug reports -- realistic-looking issue submissions crafted to mislead APR\nsystems into producing insecure or harmful code changes. We develop a\ncomprehensive threat model and conduct an empirical study to evaluate the\nvulnerability of state-of-the-art APR systems to such attacks. Our\ndemonstration comprises 51 adversarial bug reports generated across a spectrum\nof strategies, from manual curation to fully automated pipelines. We test these\nagainst leading APR model and assess both pre-repair defenses (e.g., LlamaGuard\nvariants, PromptGuard variants, Granite-Guardian, and custom LLM filters) and\npost-repair detectors (GitHub Copilot, CodeQL). Our findings show that current\ndefenses are insufficient: 90\\% of crafted bug reports triggered\nattacker-aligned patches. The best pre-repair filter blocked only 47\\%, while\npost-repair analysis-often requiring human oversight-was effective in just 58\\%\nof cases. To support scalable security testing, we introduce a prototype\nframework for automating the generation of adversarial bug reports. Our\nanalysis exposes a structural asymmetry: generating adversarial inputs is\ninexpensive, while detecting or mitigating them remains costly and error-prone.\nWe conclude with practical recommendations for improving the robustness of APR\nsystems against adversarial misuse and highlight directions for future work on\ntrustworthy automated repair.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\uff08APR\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u654c\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u62a5\u544a\u65f6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM-based APR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u654c\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u62a5\u544a\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc751\u79cd\u654c\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u62a5\u544a\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u4ece\u624b\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5230\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u6d41\u7a0b\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u6d41APR\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u4fee\u590d\u9632\u5fa1\uff08\u5982LlamaGuard\u3001PromptGuard\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u540e\u4fee\u590d\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08\u5982GitHub Copilot\u3001CodeQL\uff09\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c90%\u7684\u654c\u5bf9\u62a5\u544a\u6210\u529f\u89e6\u53d1\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u671f\u671b\u7684\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u9884\u4fee\u590d\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4ec5\u62e6\u622a47%\uff0c\u540e\u4fee\u590d\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4ec5\u4e3a58%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u654c\u5bf9\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u63d0\u5347APR\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u4fe1\u81ea\u52a8\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

A GNN module is trained to adjust contention thresholds for\nindividual links based on traffic statistics and network topology, enabling\nlinks to withdraw from scheduling contention when they are unlikely to succeed.\nOur approach is facilitated by a novel offline constrained {unsupervised}\nlearning algorithm capable of balancing two competing objectives: minimizing\nscheduling overhead while ensuring that total utility meets the required level.\nIn simulated wireless multi-hop networks with up to 500 links, our link\nsparsification technique effectively alleviates network congestion and reduces\nradio footprints across four distinct distributed link scheduling protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u94fe\u8def\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bc6\u96c6\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8c03\u5ea6\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u94fe\u8def\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u4fe1\u4ee4\u5f00\u9500\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u62e5\u585e\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5360\u7528\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8c03\u6574\u94fe\u8def\u7ade\u4e89\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u8861\u8c03\u5ea6\u5f00\u9500\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u548c\u603b\u6548\u7528\u8fbe\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728500\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u62e5\u585e\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5360\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8c03\u5ea6\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u8c03\u5ea6\u534f\u8bae\u3002"}}

Inductive invariants are inductive formulas that\noverapproximate the reachable states of a system and imply a desired safety\nproperty. However, inductive invariants are notoriously complex, which makes\ninductive invariant inference a challenging problem. In this work, we observe\nthat inductive invariant formulas are complex primarily because they must be\nclosed over the transition relation of an entire system. Therefore, we propose\na new approach in which we decompose a system into components, assign an\nassume-guarantee contract to each component, and prove that each component\nfulfills its contract by inferring a local inductive invariant. The key\nadvantage of local inductive invariant inference is that the local invariant\nneed only be closed under the transition relation for the component, which is\nsimpler than the transition relation for the entire system. Once local\ninvariant inference is complete, system-wide safety follows by construction\nbecause the conjunction of all local invariants becomes an inductive invariant\nfor the entire system. We apply our compositional inductive invariant inference\ntechnique to two case studies, in which we provide evidence that our framework\ncan infer invariants more efficiently than the global technique.

This paper introduces\nSuperSNN, a comprehensive framework for the implementation of full\nsuperconducting SNNs on a chip within these constraints. The key technical\ncontributions include: (1) A hardware-aware training methodology for SNNs,\nutilizing off-chip pruning and weight quantization for energy-efficient\nsuperconducting implementations. (2) Design and layout of an inference SNN chip\nthat incorporates novel high fan-in neurons and custom superconducting cells.\n(3) An optimized locally synchronous, globally synchronous (LAGS) clock\ndistribution scheme for robust circuit implementation and management of data\ntransfer delays in SFQ SNNs. The main results and findings demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the framework: (1) The complete network achieved 96.47%\naccuracy on the full MNIST dataset after quantization and pruning. (2) The\nfabricated SuperSNN chip successfully classified a reduced set of digits (2, 3,\nand 4) with 80.07% accuracy, reaching a maximum of 86.2% accuracy for digits 0,\n1, and 2. (3) The chip operates at an ultra-high 3.02 GHz clock frequency. (4)\nIt occupies a compact area of 3.4 x 3.9 mm^2, incorporates 5,822 Josephson\nJunctions, consumes 2.15 mW static power, and has an exceptionally low energy\ncost of 6.55 fJ (or 1.31e-6 nJ) per inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "SuperSNN \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u8d85\u5bfc\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SNN\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5236\u9020\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u82af\u7247\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728 MNIST \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5236\u9020\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ea\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c11\u91cf\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6216\u7a81\u89e6\u3002SuperSNN \u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u9ad8\u6247\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5b9a\u5236\u8d85\u5bfc\u5355\u5143\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65f6\u949f\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 96.47% \u7684 MNIST \u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u82af\u7247\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe 80.07%-86.2%\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u9891\u7387 3.02 GHz\uff0c\u529f\u8017\u6781\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "SuperSNN \u6210\u529f\u5728\u8d85\u5bfc\u82af\u7247\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This study overcomes\nthis challenge by offering a fabrication algorithm for direct 3D printing of\nsuch networks with programmed tension gradients, an approach analogous to the\nspinning of spiderwebs. The algorithm: (i) defines the desired network and\nprescribes its tension gradients using the force density method; (ii) converts\nthe network into an unstretched counterpart by numerically optimizing vertex\nlocations toward target element lengths and converting straight elements into\narcs to resolve any remaining error; and (iii) decomposes the network into\nprintable toolpaths; Optional additional steps are: (iv) flattening curved 2D\nnetworks or 3D networks to ensure 3D printing compatibility; and (v)\nautomatically resolving any unwanted crossings introduced by the flattening\nprocess. The proposed method is experimentally validated using 2D unit cells of\nviscoelastic filaments, where accurate tension gradients are achieved with an\naverage element strain error of less than 1.0\\%.

In this\npaper, we propose a high utilization energy-aware real-time inference deep\nconvolutional neural network accelerator, which improves the performance of the\ncurrent accelerators. First, we use the 1x1 size convolution kernel as the\nsmallest unit of the computing unit. Then we design suitable computing unit\nbased on the requirements of each model. Secondly, we use Reuse Feature SRAM to\nstore the output of the current layer in the chip and use the value as the\ninput of the next layer. Moreover, we import Output Reuse Strategy and Ring\nStream Dataflow to reduce the amount of data exchange between chips and DRAM.\nFinally, we present On-fly Pooling Module to let the calculation of the Pooling\nlayer directly complete in the chip. With the aid of the proposed method, the\nimplemented acceleration chip has an extremely high hardware utilization rate.\nWe reduce a generous amount of data transfer on the specific module, ECNN.\nCompared to the methods without reuse strategy, we can reduce 533 times of data\naccess amount.

Since monitors are\nsafety-critical components, it is crucial to ensure that they are free of\npotential runtime errors. One of the central challenges in designing reliable\nstream-based monitors is to deal with the asynchronous nature of data streams:\nin concrete applications, the different sensors being monitored produce values\nat different speeds, and it is the monitor's responsibility to correctly react\nto the asynchronous arrival of different streams of values. To ease this\nprocess, modern frameworks for stream-based monitoring such as RTLola feature\nan expressive specification language that allows to finely specify data\nsynchronization policies.

Traditional skeletal animation methods maintain geometric\nconsistency but struggle with complex non-rigid elements like flowing hair and\nskirts, leading to unnatural deformation. Conversely, video diffusion models\nsynthesize realistic dynamics but often create geometric distortions in\nstylized drawings due to domain gaps. This work proposes a hybrid animation\nsystem that combines skeletal animation and video diffusion. Initially, coarse\nimages are generated from characters retargeted with skeletal animations for\ngeometric guidance. These images are then enhanced in texture and secondary\ndynamics using video diffusion priors, framing this enhancement as an\ninpainting task. A domain-adapted diffusion model refines user-masked regions\nneeding improvement, especially for secondary dynamics. To enhance motion\nrealism further, we introduce a Secondary Dynamics Injection (SDI) strategy in\nthe denoising process, incorporating features from a pre-trained diffusion\nmodel enriched with human motion priors. Additionally, to tackle unnatural\ndeformations from low-poly single-mesh character modeling, we present a Hair\nLayering Modeling (HLM) technique that uses segmentation maps to separate hair\nfrom the body, allowing for more natural animation of long-haired characters.\nExtensive experiments show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nin both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u9aa8\u9abc\u52a8\u753b\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u753b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u624b\u7ed8\u89d2\u8272\u52a8\u753b\u4e2d\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u6b21\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u753b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9aa8\u9abc\u52a8\u753b\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u975e\u521a\u6027\u5143\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u5934\u53d1\u548c\u88d9\u5b50\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u52a8\u753b\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210\u9aa8\u9abc\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u7c97\u7565\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u518d\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7eb9\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u4e8c\u6b21\u52a8\u6001\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u7528\u6237\u6807\u8bb0\u533a\u57df\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e8c\u6b21\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u5165\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u9aa8\u9abc\u52a8\u753b\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u624b\u7ed8\u89d2\u8272\u52a8\u753b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Tiga consolidates concurrency control and consensus, completing both\nstrictly serializable execution and consistent replication in a single round.\nIt uses synchronized clocks to proactively order transactions by assigning each\na future timestamp at submission. In most cases, transactions arrive at servers\nbefore their future timestamps and are serialized according to the designated\ntimestamp, requiring 1 WRTT to commit. In rare cases, transactions are delayed\nand proactive ordering fails, in which case Tiga falls back to a slow path,\ncommitting in 1.5--2 WRTTs.

However, existing body models have\nsimplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint\nlocations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their\npotential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating\nbiomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion\ncapture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a\nparametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure\nthat can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL\nbody model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data\nof skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.\n  We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons\ninside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL\nmesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we\nre-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting\nSKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and\nbiomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more\nbiomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside\nthe body surface better than previous methods.

In\nparticular, we recognize that ECC chips (used for parity storage) do not\nnecessarily require the same performance level as regular data chips. This\noffers two-fold benefits: First, the bandwidth originally provisioned for a\nregular-performance ECC chip can instead be used to accommodate multiple\nlow-performance chips. Second, the cost of ECC chips can be effectively\nreduced, as lower performance often correlates with lower expense. In addition,\nwe observe that server-class memory chips are often provisioned with ample, yet\nunderutilized I/O resources.

However, these\nmodels are constrained by the limited diversity of publicly available scene\ndatasets, making most real-world (in-the-wild) scenes out-of-distribution. To\novercome this, we incorporate synthetic training data generated from diffusion\nmodels, which improves generalization across unseen domains. While synthetic\ndata offers scalability, we identify artifacts introduced during data\ngeneration as a key bottleneck affecting reconstruction quality. To address\nthis, we propose a token disentanglement process within the transformer\narchitecture, enhancing feature separation and ensuring more effective\nlearning. This refinement not only improves reconstruction quality over\nstandard transformers but also enables scalable training with synthetic data.\nAs a result, our method outperforms existing models on both in-dataset and\ncross-dataset evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple\nbenchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs.

A recent approach, called multiverse debugging, makes it\neasier to debug non-deterministic programs by allowing programmers to explore\nall potential execution paths. Current multiverse debuggers enable both forward\nand backward traversal of program paths, and some facilitate jumping to any\npreviously visited states, potentially branching into alternative execution\npaths within the state space.\n  Unfortunately, debugging programs that involve input/output operations using\nexisting multiverse debuggers can reveal inaccessible program states, i.e.\nstates which are not encountered during regular execution. This can\nsignificantly hinder the debugging process, as the programmer may spend\nsubstantial time exploring and examining inaccessible program states, or worse,\nmay mistakenly assume a bug is present in the code, when in fact, the issue is\ncaused by the debugger.\n  This paper presents a novel approach to multiverse debugging, which can\naccommodate a broad spectrum of input/output operations. We provide the\nsemantics of our approach and prove the correctness of our debugger, ensuring\nthat despite having support for a wide range of input/output operations the\ndebugger will only explore those program states which can be reached during\nregular execution.\n  We have developed a prototype, called MIO, leveraging the WARDuino\nWebAssembly virtual machine to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of\nour techniques.

They overly rely on textual similarity\nfor retrieval, neglecting structural relationships such as call chains and\ninheritance hierarchies, and lose critical structural information by naively\nconcatenating retrieved snippets into text sequences for LLM input. To address\nthese shortcomings, GRACE constructs a multi-level, multi-semantic code graph\nthat unifies file structures, abstract syntax trees, function call graphs,\nclass hierarchies, and data flow graphs to capture both static and dynamic code\nsemantics.

While prior research has\nprimarily focused on computing energy-efficient paths from a source to a\ndestination, these approaches often overlook practical scenarios where a robot\nneeds to pick up an object en route - an action that can significantly impact\nenergy consumption due to changes in payload. This paper introduces the\nObject-Pickup Minimum Energy Path Problem (OMEPP), which addresses\nenergy-efficient route planning for AMRs required to pick up an object from one\nof many possible locations and deliver it to a destination. To address OMEPP,\nwe first introduce a baseline algorithm that employs the Z star algorithm, a\nvariant of A star tailored for energy-efficient routing, to iteratively visit\neach pickup point. While this approach guarantees optimality, it suffers from\nhigh computational cost due to repeated searches at each pickup location. To\nmitigate this inefficiency, we propose a concurrent PCPD search that manages\nmultiple Z star searches simultaneously across all pickup points.

In recent\nyears, numerous learning-based SPD approaches have demonstrated promising\nresults on source code. However, these approaches typically cannot be applied\nto closed-source applications and proprietary systems that constitute a\nsignificant portion of real-world software, as they release patches only with\nbinary files, and the source code is inaccessible. Given the impressive\nperformance of code large language models (LLMs) in code intelligence and\nbinary analysis tasks such as decompilation and compilation optimization, their\npotential for detecting binary security patches remains unexplored, exposing a\nsignificant research gap between their demonstrated low-level code\nunderstanding capabilities and this critical security task. To address this\ngap, we construct a large-scale binary patch dataset containing \\textbf{19,448}\nsamples, with two levels of representation: assembly code and pseudo-code, and\nsystematically evaluate \\textbf{19} code LLMs of varying scales to investigate\ntheir capability in binary SPD tasks.

To harness these new capabilities while ensuring\ntrustworthiness, we must recognize a fundamental duality within the SE field in\nthe Agentic SE era, comprising two symbiotic modalities: SE for Humans and SE\nfor Agents. This duality demands a radical reimagining of the foundational\npillars of SE (actors, processes, tools, and artifacts) which manifest\ndifferently across each modality. We propose two purpose-built workbenches to\nsupport this vision. The Agent Command Environment (ACE) serves as a command\ncenter where humans orchestrate and mentor agent teams, handling outputs such\nas Merge-Readiness Packs (MRPs) and Consultation Request Packs (CRPs). The\nAgent Execution Environment (AEE) is a digital workspace where agents perform\ntasks while invoking human expertise when facing ambiguity or complex\ntrade-offs. This bi-directional partnership, which supports agent-initiated\nhuman callbacks and handovers, gives rise to new, structured engineering\nactivities (i.e., processes) that redefine human-AI collaboration, elevating\nthe practice from agentic coding to true agentic software engineering.

While software\norganizations are recommended to conduct postmortems, the effectiveness and\nadoption of these practices vary widely. Understanding how engineers gather,\ndocument, share, and apply lessons from failures is essential for improving\nreliability and preventing recurrence. High-reliability organizations (HROs)\noften develop software systems where failures carry catastrophic risks,\nrequiring continuous learning to ensure reliability. These organizations\nprovide a valuable setting to examine practices and challenges for learning\nfrom software failures. Such insight could help develop processes and tools to\nimprove reliability and prevent recurrence. However, we lack in-depth industry\nperspectives on the practices and challenges of learning from failures.\n  To address this gap, we conducted a case study through 10 in-depth interviews\nwith research software engineers at a national space research center. We\nexamine how they learn from failures: how they gather, document, share, and\napply lessons. To assess transferability, we include data from 5 additional\ninterviews at other HROs.

In this paper, we develop mmTunnel, a\nmillimeter-wave radar system that achieves far-range vehicle detection in\ntunnels. The main challenge here is coping with ghost points caused by\nmulti-path reflections, which lead to severe localization errors and false\nalarms. Instead of merely removing ghost points, we propose correcting them to\ntrue vehicle positions by recovering their signal reflection paths, thus\nreserving more data points and improving detection performance, even in\nocclusion scenarios. However, recovering complex 3D reflection paths from\nlimited 2D radar points is highly challenging. To address this problem, we\ndevelop a multi-path ray tracing algorithm that leverages the ground plane\nconstraint and identifies the most probable reflection path based on signal\npath loss and spatial distance. We also introduce a curve-to-plane segmentation\nmethod to simplify tunnel surface modeling such that we can significantly\nreduce the computational delay and achieve real-time processing.\n  We have evaluated mmTunnel with comprehensive experiments. In two test\ntunnels, we conducted controlled experiments in various scenarios with cars and\ntrucks. Our system achieves an average F1 score of 93.7% for vehicle detection\nwhile maintaining real-time processing. Even in the challenging occlusion\nscenarios, the F1 score remains above 91%. Moreover, we collected extensive\ndata from a public tunnel with heavy traffic at times and show our method could\nachieve an F1 score of 91.5% in real-world traffic conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "mmTunnel\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u96a7\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u8f66\u8f86\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea0\u6b63\u591a\u5f84\u53cd\u5c04\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5e7d\u7075\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u96a7\u9053\u4e2d\u8f66\u8f86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u591a\u5f84\u53cd\u5c04\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e7d\u7075\u70b9\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5f84\u5149\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u66f2\u7ebf\u5230\u5e73\u9762\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u96a7\u9053\u8868\u9762\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96a7\u9053\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747F1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe\u523093.7%\uff0c\u5728\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u9ad8\u4e8e91%\u3002", "conclusion": "mmTunnel\u5728\u590d\u6742\u96a7\u9053\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, harsh space\nenvironments make satellites vulnerable to failures, leading to node removals\nthat disrupt inter-satellite networking. With the high risk of satellite node\nfailures, understanding their impact on end-to-end services is essential. This\nstudy investigates the importance of individual nodes on inter-satellite\nnetworking and the resilience of mega satellite constellations against node\nfailures. We represent the mega-satellite constellation as discrete temporal\ngraphs and model node failure events accordingly. To quantify node importance\nfor targeted services over time, we propose a service-aware temporal\nbetweenness metric. Leveraging this metric, we develop an analytical framework\nto identify critical nodes and assess the impact of node failures. The\nframework takes node failure events as input and efficiently evaluates their\nimpacts across current and subsequent time windows. Simulations on the Starlink\nconstellation setting reveal that satellite networks inherently exhibit\nresilience to node failures, as their dynamic topology partially restore\nconnectivity and mitigate the long-term impact.

In this context, leveraging the densely deployed 5G\nbase stations (BS) for radar sensing is particularly promising, offering both\nwide coverage and immediate feedback to 5G scheduling. However, the targeting\nradar signals are superimposed with concurrent 5G uplink transmissions received\nby the BS, and practical deployment also demands a lightweight, portable radar\nsensing model. This paper presents BatStation, a lightweight, in-situ radar\nsensing framework seamlessly integrated into 5G BSs. BatStation leverages\nuplink resource grids to extract radar signals through three key components:\n(i) radar signal separation to cancel concurrent 5G transmissions and reveal\nthe radar signals, (ii) resource grid reshaping to align time-frequency\nresolution with radar pulse characteristics, and (iii) zero-shot template\ncorrelation based on a portable model trained purely on synthetic data that\nsupports detection, classification, and localization of radar pulses without\nfine-tuning using experimental data. We implement BatStation on a\nsoftware-defined radio (SDR) testbed and evaluate its performance with real 5G\ntraffic in the CBRS band. Results show robust performance across diverse radar\ntypes, achieving detection probabilities of 97.02% (PUCCH) and 79.23% (PUSCH),\nclassification accuracy up to 97.00%, and median localization errors of\n2.68-6.20 MHz (frequency) and 24.6-32.4 microseconds (time).

Particularly, in a\nvehicular network with multiple vehicles and base stations (BSs), computing\ntasks of vehicles are offloaded via BSs to an edge server. Due to the random\nvelocities, the exact locations of vehicles versus time, namely trajectories,\ncannot be determined in advance. Hence, instead of deterministic optimization,\nthe cell association, uplink time, and throughput allocation of multiple\nvehicles during a period of task offloading are formulated as a finite-horizon\nMarkov decision process. In order to derive a low-complexity solution\nalgorithm, a two-time-scale framework is proposed. The scheduling period is\ndivided into super slots, each super slot is further divided into a number of\ntime slots. At the beginning of each super slot, we first obtain a reference\nscheduling scheme of cell association, uplink time and throughput allocation\nvia deterministic optimization, yielding an approximation of the optimal value\nfunction.

Here, a large share of\nexperts prioritizes efficiency-loving preferences over pure self-interest.\nDisclosing these preferences to consumers induces strong efficiency gains by\nmarginalizing self-interested LLM experts and human experts. Consequently,\nHuman-AI-Human markets outperform Human-Human markets under transparency rules.\nWith obfuscation, however, efficiency gains disappear, and adverse expert\nincentives remain. Our results shed light on the potential opportunities and\nrisks of disseminating LLMs in the context of expert services and raise several\nregulatory challenges. On the one hand, LLMs can negatively affect human trust\nin the presence of information asymmetries and partially crowd-out experts'\nother-regarding preferences through automation. On the other hand, LLMs allow\nexperts to codify and communicate their objective function, which reduces\ninformation asymmetries and increases efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6b63\u5728\u6539\u53d8\u4e13\u5bb6\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0Human-Human\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u6548\u7387\u901a\u5e38\u9ad8\u4e8eAI-AI\u548cHuman-AI\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u4f46LLM\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ecd\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5269\u4f59\u3002\u900f\u660e\u89c4\u5219\u4e0b\uff0cHuman-AI-Human\u5e02\u573a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eHuman-Human\u5e02\u573a\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\uff08\u5982LLMs\uff09\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u670d\u52a1\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u798f\u5229\u548c\u5206\u914d\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u673a\u9047\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u7528\u5546\u54c1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790AI-AI\u3001Human-Human\u3001Human-AI\u548cHuman-AI-Human\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "Human-Human\u5e02\u573a\u901a\u8fc7\u4eb2\u793e\u4f1a\u4e13\u5bb6\u504f\u597d\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4fe1\u4efb\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u900f\u660e\u89c4\u5219\u4e0b\uff0cHuman-AI-Human\u5e02\u573a\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u65e2\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u51cf\u5c11\u4eb2\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u900f\u660e\u89c4\u5219\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u76d1\u7ba1\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

As the primary architects of XR applications, developers play a\ncritical role in addressing novel threats. However, to effectively support\ndevelopers, we must first understand how they perceive and respond to different\nthreats. Despite the growing importance of this issue, there is a lack of\nin-depth, threat-aware studies that examine XR S&P from the developers'\nperspective. To fill this gap, we interviewed 23 professional XR developers\nwith a focus on emerging threats in XR. Our study addresses two research\nquestions aiming to uncover existing problems in XR development and identify\nactionable paths forward.\n  By examining developers' perceptions of S&P threats, we found that: (1) XR\ndevelopment decisions (e.g., rich sensor data collection, user-generated\ncontent interfaces) are closely tied to and can amplify S&P threats, yet\ndevelopers are often unaware of these risks, resulting in cognitive biases in\nthreat perception; and (2) limitations in existing mitigation methods, combined\nwith insufficient strategic, technical, and communication support, undermine\ndevelopers' motivation, awareness, and ability to effectively address these\nthreats. Based on these findings, we propose actionable and stakeholder-aware\nrecommendations to improve XR S&P throughout the XR development process. This\nwork represents the first effort to undertake a threat-aware,\ndeveloper-centered study in the XR domain -- an area where the immersive,\ndata-rich nature of the XR technology introduces distinctive challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86XR\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u5e94\u5bf9\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u7565\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22XR\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u770b\u5f85\u65b0\u5174\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u8bbf\u8c0823\u4f4d\u4e13\u4e1aXR\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u51b3\u7b56\u53ef\u80fd\u653e\u5927\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdbXR\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

The controller integrates streaming personalized VAD (pVAD)\nto suppress false barge-ins from noise and non-primary speakers, precisely\ntimestamp primary-speaker segments, and explicitly enable primary-speaker\nbarge-ins; a semantic end-of-turn detector improves stop decisions. It upgrades\nheterogeneous half-duplex pipelines, cascaded, semi-cascaded, and\nspeech-to-speech, to full duplex. Using internal models, we implement cascaded\nand semi-cascaded variants; the semi-cascaded one captures emotional and\nparalinguistic cues, yields more coherent responses, lowers latency and error\npropagation, and improves robustness. A dialogue manager extends capabilities\nvia tool invocation and context management. We also propose three system-level\nmetrics, barge-in, end-of-turn detection accuracy, and end-to-end latency, to\nassess naturalness, control accuracy, and efficiency. Experiments show fewer\nfalse interruptions, more accurate semantic ends, and lower latency approaching\nindustrial systems, enabling robust, natural, real-time full-duplex\ninteraction.
