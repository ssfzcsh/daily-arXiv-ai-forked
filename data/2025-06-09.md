<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实中的广泛应用，理解和减少其不安全行为变得至关重要。然而，现有综述往往忽略了解释技术与安全性之间的联系。

Method: 提出一个统一的框架，连接了以安全为重点的解释方法、由此启发的安全改进及其实操工具，并按LLM工作流程阶段分类总结了近70项研究。

Result: 提出了一个新颖的分类法，帮助研究者和从业者更好地理解和应用解释技术以提升LLM的安全性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 本文填补了现有文献的空白，为构建更安全、更可解释的大语言模型提供了重要参考，并指出了未来的研究方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) see wider real-world use, understanding and
mitigating their unsafe behaviors is critical. Interpretation techniques can
reveal causes of unsafe outputs and guide safety, but such connections with
safety are often overlooked in prior surveys. We present the first survey that
bridges this gap, introducing a unified framework that connects safety-focused
interpretation methods, the safety enhancements they inform, and the tools that
operationalize them. Our novel taxonomy, organized by LLM workflow stages,
summarizes nearly 70 works at their intersections. We conclude with open
challenges and future directions. This timely survey helps researchers and
practitioners navigate key advancements for safer, more interpretable LLMs.

*Tianyi Zhang,Shidong Pan,Zejun Zhang,Zhenchang Xing,Xiaoyu Sun*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了IaCGen框架和DPIaC-Eval基准，用于从自然语言生成可部署的基础设施即代码模板，并通过迭代反馈机制显著提升了部署成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前基础设施即代码（IaC）生成中忽略可部署性的问题，利用大语言模型（LLMs）实现从自然语言到可部署模板的自动化。

Method: 提出了IaCGen框架（基于LLMs的迭代反馈机制生成模板）和DPIaC-Eval基准（包含153个真实场景，评估语法、部署、用户意图和安全性）。

Result: 初始LLMs表现不佳（部署成功率30%左右），但通过IaCGen框架将成功率提升至90%以上；用户意图对齐和安全性仍需改进。

Conclusion: 该研究为可部署性中心的IaC模板生成提供了首个全面评估框架，并指明未来研究方向（用户意图和安全性）。

Abstract: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) generation holds significant promise for
automating cloud infrastructure provisioning. Recent advances in Large Language
Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to democratize IaC development by
generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language
descriptions, but current evaluation focuses on syntactic correctness while
ignoring deployability, the fatal measure of IaC template utility. We address
this gap through two contributions: (1) IaCGen, an LLM-based
deployability-centric framework that uses iterative feedback mechanism to
generate IaC templates, and (2) DPIaC-Eval, a deployability-centric IaC
template benchmark consists of 153 real-world scenarios that can evaluate
syntax, deployment, user intent, and security. Our evaluation reveals that
state-of-the-art LLMs initially performed poorly, with Claude-3.5 and
Claude-3.7 achieving only 30.2% and 26.8% deployment success on the first
attempt respectively. However, IaCGen transforms this performance dramatically:
all evaluated models reach over 90% passItr@25, with Claude-3.5 and Claude-3.7
achieving 98% success rate. Despite these improvements, critical challenges
remain in user intent alignment (25.2% accuracy) and security compliance (8.4%
pass rate), highlighting areas requiring continued research. Our work provides
the first comprehensive assessment of deployability-centric IaC template
generation and establishes a foundation for future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LLM的自动生成高质量测试用例的系统，并构建了改进版的CodeContests+数据集，显著提升了测试用例的准确性和RL训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决竞争编程问题中测试用例难以获取的问题，提升数据集的评估准确性。

Method: 引入LLM-based agent系统生成高质量测试用例，应用于CodeContests数据集，构建CodeContests+。

Result: CodeContests+显著提高了测试用例的准确性（TPR更高），并在LLM RL实验中展现了优势。

Conclusion: 高质量的测试用例对竞争编程问题的评估和LLM训练具有重要价值。

Abstract: Competitive programming, due to its high reasoning difficulty and precise
correctness feedback, has become a key task for both training and evaluating
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, while a
large amount of public problem data, such as problem statements and solutions,
is available, the test cases of these problems are often difficult to obtain.
Therefore, test case generation is a necessary task for building large-scale
datasets, and the quality of the test cases directly determines the accuracy of
the evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-based agent system that
creates high-quality test cases for competitive programming problems. We apply
this system to the CodeContests dataset and propose a new version with improved
test cases, named CodeContests+. We evaluated the quality of test cases in
CodeContestsPlus. First, we used 1.72 million submissions with pass/fail labels
to examine the accuracy of these test cases in evaluation. The results
indicated that CodeContests+ achieves significantly higher accuracy than
CodeContests, particularly with a notably higher True Positive Rate (TPR).
Subsequently, our experiments in LLM Reinforcement Learning (RL) further
confirmed that improvements in test case quality yield considerable advantages
for RL.

Abstract: This survey investigates how classical software design patterns can enhance
the reliability and scalability of communication in Large Language Model
(LLM)-driven agentic AI systems, focusing particularly on the Model Context
Protocol (MCP). It examines the foundational architectures of LLM-based agents
and their evolution from isolated operation to sophisticated, multi-agent
collaboration, addressing key communication hurdles that arise in this
transition. The study revisits well-established patterns, including Mediator,
Observer, Publish-Subscribe, and Broker, and analyzes their relevance in
structuring agent interactions within MCP-compliant frameworks. To clarify
these dynamics, the article provides conceptual schematics and formal models
that map out communication pathways and optimize data flow. It further explores
architectural variations suited to different degrees of agent autonomy and
system complexity. Real-world applications in domains such as real-time
financial processing and investment banking are discussed, illustrating how
these patterns and MCP can meet specific operational demands. The article
concludes by outlining open challenges, potential security risks, and promising
directions for advancing robust, interoperable, and scalable multi-agent LLM
ecosystems.

*E. G. Santana Jr,Gabriel Benjamin,Melissa Araujo,Harrison Santos,David Freitas,Eduardo Almeida,Paulo Anselmo da M. S. Neto,Jiawei Li,Jina Chun,Iftekhar Ahmed*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了14种提示工程技术在10个软件工程任务上的表现，分析了不同提示技术在逻辑推理和上下文理解任务中的有效性，并提供了实际应用中的选择建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLM）在软件工程（SE）任务中的应用日益广泛，但缺乏对不同提示技术在这些任务上的系统性评估，因此需要研究哪些提示技术最适合不同类型的SE任务。

Method: 研究评估了14种提示技术，涵盖6个核心维度（如零样本、少样本、思维生成等），并在10个SE任务上测试了4种LLM模型的表现。任务包括代码生成、错误修复等。

Result: 研究发现，不同的提示技术在不同类型的SE任务中有显著差异，逻辑推理任务与上下文理解任务对提示技术的需求不同。研究还分析了提示语言特征与任务性能的关系，并提供了时间和令牌消耗数据。

Conclusion: 该研究为实践者提供了选择最佳提示技术的依据，并揭示了提示技术在SE任务中的性能差异与适用场景。

Abstract: A growing variety of prompt engineering techniques has been proposed for
Large Language Models (LLMs), yet systematic evaluation of each technique on
individual software engineering (SE) tasks remains underexplored. In this
study, we present a systematic evaluation of 14 established prompt techniques
across 10 SE tasks using four LLM models. As identified in the prior
literature, the selected prompting techniques span six core dimensions
(Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Thought Generation, Ensembling, Self-Criticism, and
Decomposition). They are evaluated on tasks such as code generation, bug
fixing, and code-oriented question answering, to name a few. Our results show
which prompting techniques are most effective for SE tasks requiring complex
logic and intensive reasoning versus those that rely more on contextual
understanding and example-driven scenarios. We also analyze correlations
between the linguistic characteristics of prompts and the factors that
contribute to the effectiveness of prompting techniques in enhancing
performance on SE tasks. Additionally, we report the time and token consumption
for each prompting technique when applied to a specific task and model,
offering guidance for practitioners in selecting the optimal prompting
technique for their use cases.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究通过系统文献综述，为车载混合关键性软件架构提供了实践指导，并提出了适用于高性能计算环境的架构设计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着集中式电子架构和高性能计算机在汽车软件开发中的应用，传统方法面临挑战，需验证和优化混合关键性软件的集成方式。

Result: 提出了适用于微处理器芯片的示例架构，为行业和研究提供了结构化的软件集成方法。

Conclusion: 研究为下一代车载软件架构提供了实用指导，展示了系统方法的有效性。

Abstract: Centralized electrical/electronic architectures and High-Performance
Computers (HPCs) are redefining automotive software development, challenging
traditional microcontroller-based approaches. Ensuring real-time, safety, and
scalability in software-defined vehicles necessitates reevaluating how
mixed-criticality software is integrated into centralized architectures. While
existing research on automotive SoftWare Architectures (SWAs) is relevant to
the industry, it often lacks validation through systematic, empirical methods.
To address this gap, we conduct a systematic literature review focusing on
automotive mixed-criticality SWAs. Our goal is to provide practitioner-oriented
guidelines that assist automotive software architects and developers design
centralized, mixed-criticality SWAs based on a rigorous and transparent
methodology. First, we set up a systematic review protocol grounded in
established guidelines. Second, we apply this protocol to identify relevant
studies. Third, we extract key functional domains, constraints, and enabling
technologies that drive changes in automotive SWAs, thereby assessing the
protocol's effectiveness. Additionally, we extract techniques, architectural
patterns, and design practices for integrating mixed-criticality requirements
into HPC-based SWAs, further demonstrating the protocol's applicability. Based
on these insights, we propose an exemplary SWA for a microprocessor-based
system-on-chip. In conclusion, this study provides a structured approach to
explore and realize mixed-criticality software integration for next-generation
automotive SWAs, offering valuable insights for industry and research
applications.

Abstract: Competitive programming contests play a crucial role in cultivating
computational thinking and algorithmic skills among learners. However,
generating comprehensive test cases to effectively assess programming solutions
remains resource-intensive and challenging for educators. This paper introduces
an innovative NLP-driven method leveraging generative AI (large language
models) to automate the creation of high-quality test cases for competitive
programming assessments. We extensively evaluated our approach on diverse
datasets, including 25 years of Romanian Informatics Olympiad (OJI) data for
5th graders, recent competitions hosted on the Kilonova.ro platform, and the
International Informatics Olympiad in Teams (IIOT). Our results demonstrate
that AI-generated test cases substantially enhanced assessments, notably
identifying previously undetected errors in 67% of the OJI 5th grade
programming problems. These improvements underscore the complementary
educational value of our technique in formative assessment contexts. By openly
sharing our prompts, translated datasets, and methodologies, we offer practical
NLP-based tools that educators and contest organizers can readily integrate to
enhance assessment quality, reduce workload, and deepen insights into learner
performance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种语言无关的数据依赖表示系统，解决污点分析中的两大挑战：外部库调用的手动标注需求和全程序图表示的可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前污点分析技术在漏洞发现中面临两大挑战：一是对外部库调用的精确建模需要大量手动标注，二是在持续开发环境中全程序图表示的可扩展性和性能问题。

Method: 设计并实现了一种语言无关的数据依赖表示系统，通过过度近似数据流来解决缺失标注问题，并允许后续添加标注而无需重新计算。该系统集成到开源代码分析平台Joern中。

Result: 提出的系统能够在缺少标注的情况下进行污点分析，同时支持后续标注的灵活添加，提高了分析的实用性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该系统为污点分析提供了一种更高效和灵活的工具，解决了当前技术的局限，适用于持续开发环境中的漏洞发现。

Abstract: Taint analysis using explicit whole-program data-dependence graphs is
powerful for vulnerability discovery but faces two major challenges. First,
accurately modeling taint propagation through calls to external library
procedures requires extensive manual annotations, which becomes impractical for
large ecosystems. Second, the sheer size of whole-program graph representations
leads to serious scalability and performance issues, particularly when quick
analysis is needed in continuous development pipelines.
  This paper presents the design and implementation of a system for a
language-agnostic data-dependence representation. The system accommodates
missing annotations describing the behavior of library procedures by
over-approximating data flows, allowing annotations to be added later without
recalculation. We contribute this data-flow analysis system to the open-source
code analysis platform Joern making it available to the community.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DesignBench是一个多框架、多任务的前端工程评估基准，填补了现有基准在框架支持、任务多样性和多维评估上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前端UI代码生成基准缺乏主流开发框架支持，任务单一，且评估维度过窄。

Method: 引入DesignBench，涵盖React、Vue、Angular和原生HTML/CSS，评估生成、编辑和修复三大任务，包含900个网页样本。

Result: 系统评估揭示了MLLM在框架特定限制、任务瓶颈和不同条件下的性能差异。

Conclusion: DesignBench为自动化前端开发的未来研究提供了方向和数据支持。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in automated front-end engineering, e.g., generating UI code from
visual designs. However, existing front-end UI code generation benchmarks have
the following limitations: (1) While framework-based development becomes
predominant in modern front-end programming, current benchmarks fail to
incorporate mainstream development frameworks. (2) Existing evaluations focus
solely on the UI code generation task, whereas practical UI development
involves several iterations, including refining editing, and repairing issues.
(3) Current benchmarks employ unidimensional evaluation, lacking investigation
into influencing factors like task difficulty, input context variations, and
in-depth code-level analysis. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DesignBench, a
multi-framework, multi-task evaluation benchmark for assessing MLLMs'
capabilities in automated front-end engineering. DesignBench encompasses three
widely-used UI frameworks (React, Vue, and Angular) alongside vanilla HTML/CSS,
and evaluates on three essential front-end tasks (generation, edit, and repair)
in real-world development workflows. DesignBench contains 900 webpage samples
spanning over 11 topics, 9 edit types, and 6 issue categories, enabling
detailed analysis of MLLM performance across multiple dimensions. Our
systematic evaluation reveals critical insights into MLLMs' framework-specific
limitations, task-related bottlenecks, and performance variations under
different conditions, providing guidance for future research in automated
front-end development. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/WebPAI/DesignBench.

Abstract: Session types are abstractions of communication protocols enabling the static
analysis of message-passing processes. Refinement notions for session types are
key to support safe forms of process substitution while preserving their
compatibility with the rest of the system. Recently, a fair refinement relation
for asynchronous session types has been defined allowing the anticipation of
message outputs with respect to an unbounded number of message inputs. This
refinement is useful to capture common patterns in communication protocols that
take advantage of asynchrony. However, while the semantic (\`a la testing)
definition of such refinement is straightforward, its characterization has
proved to be quite challenging. In fact, only a sound but not complete
characterization is known so far. In this paper we close this open problem by
presenting a sound and complete characterization of asynchronous fair
refinement for session types. We relate this characterization to those given in
the literature for synchronous session types by leveraging a novel labelled
transition system of session types that embeds their asynchronous semantics.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: CompilerGPT利用LLM自动理解编译器优化报告并重写代码，实验表明在某些情况下可将性能提升至6.5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决编译器优化报告复杂难懂的问题，提升程序员效率。

Method: 引入CompilerGPT框架，结合LLM、编译器和测试工具，迭代优化代码。

Result: 实验中使用GPT-4o和Claude Sonnet，在两款编译器和五个基准测试中取得最高6.5倍的性能提升。

Conclusion: CompilerGPT有望提高编译器的易用性，简化软件优化流程。

Abstract: Current compiler optimization reports often present complex, technical
information that is difficult for programmers to interpret and act upon
effectively. This paper assesses the capability of large language models (LLM)
to understand compiler optimization reports and automatically rewrite the code
accordingly.
  To this end, the paper introduces CompilerGPT, a novel framework that
automates the interaction between compilers, LLMs, and user defined test and
evaluation harness. CompilerGPT's workflow runs several iterations and reports
on the obtained results.
  Experiments with two leading LLM models (GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet),
optimization reports from two compilers (Clang and GCC), and five benchmark
codes demonstrate the potential of this approach. Speedups of up to 6.5x were
obtained, though not consistently in every test. This method holds promise for
improving compiler usability and streamlining the software optimization
process.

TL;DR: Pegasus通过将深度学习操作转化为数据平面友好的三种原语（Partition、Map、SumReduce），解决了现有数据平面（IDP）在准确性、规模和通用性上的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据平面的匹配动作表（MAT）抽象与深度学习推理不匹配，导致准确性下降、规模受限和缺乏通用性。

Method: 提出Pegasus框架，将DL操作转换为三种数据平面原语，并采用Primitive Fusion合并计算以提升可扩展性。还使用全精度权重和定点激活来提高准确性。

Result: 在P4交换机上的实现表明，Pegasus支持多种DL模型（如MLP、RNN、CNN、AutoEncoder），并显著优于现有方法，平均准确性提升22.8%，模型规模和输入规模分别提升248倍和212倍。

Conclusion: Pegasus通过优化数据平面的DL推理方式，大幅提升了准确性、规模和通用性，为智能数据平面的快速发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The paradigm of Intelligent DataPlane (IDP) embeds deep learning (DL) models
on the network dataplane to enable intelligent traffic analysis at line-speed.
However, the current use of the match-action table (MAT) abstraction on the
dataplane is misaligned with DL inference, leading to several key limitations,
including accuracy degradation, limited scale, and lack of generality. This
paper proposes Pegasus to address these limitations. Pegasus translates DL
operations into three dataplane-oriented primitives to achieve generality:
Partition, Map, and SumReduce. Specifically, Partition "divides"
high-dimensional features into multiple low-dimensional vectors, making them
more suitable for the dataplane; Map "conquers" computations on the
low-dimensional vectors in parallel with the technique of fuzzy matching, while
SumReduce "combines" the computation results. Additionally, Pegasus employs
Primitive Fusion to merge computations, improving scalability. Finally, Pegasus
adopts full precision weights with fixed-point activations to improve accuracy.
Our implementation on a P4 switch demonstrates that Pegasus can effectively
support various types of DL models, including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and
AutoEncoder models on the dataplane. Meanwhile, Pegasus outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches with an average accuracy improvement of up to
22.8%, along with up to 248x larger model size and 212x larger input scale.

*Pawel Kryszkiewicz,Hanna Bogucka*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种非决策辅助的高阶组合（HOC）接收方案，用于解决多载波信号由功率放大器（PA）引起的非线性失真问题。通过机器学习确定符号组合系数，仿真结果显示出比标准接收器和决策辅助接收器更好的误码率性能。但HOC的计算复杂度随子载波数量迅速增加，适用于宽带系统仍需进一步研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多载波信号的非线性失真对设计高能效无线系统构成严重挑战，现有高级接收器多为决策辅助型，其优势在低误码率区域明显，但自适应调制编码方案（FEC）目标区域不在该范围。因此需要一种非决策辅助的解决方案。

Method: 提出非决策辅助的高阶组合（HOC）接收方案，通过机器学习推导符号组合系数。

Result: 仿真结果显示，HOC在误码率性能上优于标准接收器和一种已建立的决策辅助接收器。

Conclusion: HOC是一种有效的非线性失真补偿方案，但由于计算复杂度随子载波数量快速增加，其在宽带系统中的应用还需进一步研究。

Abstract: Nonlinear distortion of a multicarrier signal by a transmitter Power
Amplifier (PA) can be a serious problem when designing new highly
energy-efficient wireless systems. Although the performance of standard
reception algorithms is seriously deteriorated by the nonlinear distortion, the
more advanced solutions allow the utilization of additional frequency diversity
caused by nonlinear PA. However, while most of the advanced receivers are
decision-aided, their gains are observed mostly in a relatively low Bit Error
Rate (BER) region, not targeted by adaptive Modulation Coding Schemes utilizing
Forward Error Correction (FEC). In this paper, a non-decision-aided
Higher-Order Combining (HOC) reception scheme is proposed. While the analytical
formulas for finding symbols combining coefficients are not known, machine
learning is used for deriving them. The simulation results show an improved BER
performance with respect to a standard reception and one of the established
decision-aided receivers. However, as HOC has computational complexity that
increases rapidly with the number of subcarriers utilized, more studies are
needed to apply it in a wideband system.

Conclusion: 该研究为Wi-Fi技术在工业无线网络中的实际应用提供了定量评估和参考。

Abstract: To ensure an unprecedented degree of flexibility, next-generation Industry
4.0/5.0 production plants increasingly rely on mobile devices, e.g., autonomous
mobile robots and wearables. In these cases, a major requirement is getting rid
of cables through the adoption of wireless networks. To this purpose, Wi-Fi is
currently deemed one of the most promising solutions. Achieving reliable
communications over the air for distributed real-time control applications is,
however, not devoid of troubles. In fact, bounded transmission latency must be
ensured for most of the exchanged packets. Moreover, for devices powered on
batteries, energy consumption also needs to be taken into account. In this
paper, a joint simulated analysis of these aspects is carried out to
quantitatively evaluate what we can practically expect from Wi-Fi technology.

Abstract: Generative AI advances rapidly, allowing the creation of very realistic
manipulated video and audio. This progress presents a significant security and
ethical threat, as malicious users can exploit DeepFake techniques to spread
misinformation. Recent DeepFake detection approaches explore the multimodal
(audio-video) threat scenario. In particular, there is a lack of
reproducibility and critical issues with existing datasets - such as the
recently uncovered silence shortcut in the widely used FakeAVCeleb dataset.
Considering the importance of this topic, we aim to gain a deeper understanding
of the key issues affecting benchmarking in audio-video DeepFake detection. We
examine these challenges through the lens of the three core benchmarking
pillars: datasets, detection methods, and evaluation protocols. To address
these issues, we spotlight the recent DeepSpeak v1 dataset and are the first to
propose an evaluation protocol and benchmark it using SOTA models. We introduce
SImple Multimodal BAseline (SIMBA), a competitive yet minimalistic approach
that enables the exploration of diverse design choices. We also deepen insights
into the issue of audio shortcuts and present a promising mitigation strategy.
Finally, we analyze and enhance the evaluation scheme on the widely used
FakeAVCeleb dataset. Our findings offer a way forward in the complex area of
audio-video DeepFake detection.

Result: 在24种模型-数据-水印组合场景中，PnP成功伪造水印（检测率和用户归因高达100%），并保持最佳视觉感知效果。

Abstract: Watermarking becomes one of the pivotal solutions to trace and verify the
origin of synthetic images generated by artificial intelligence models, but it
is not free of risks. Recent studies demonstrate the capability to forge
watermarks from a target image onto cover images via adversarial optimization
without knowledge of the target generative model and watermark schemes. In this
paper, we uncover a greater risk of an optimization-free and universal
watermark forgery that harnesses existing regenerative diffusion models. Our
proposed forgery attack, PnP (Plug-and-Plant), seamlessly extracts and
integrates the target watermark via regenerating the image, without needing any
additional optimization routine. It allows for universal watermark forgery that
works independently of the target image's origin or the watermarking model
used. We explore the watermarked latent extracted from the target image and
visual-textual context of cover images as priors to guide sampling of the
regenerative process. Extensive evaluation on 24 scenarios of
model-data-watermark combinations demonstrates that PnP can successfully forge
the watermark (up to 100% detectability and user attribution), and maintain the
best visual perception. By bypassing model retraining and enabling adaptability
to any image, our approach significantly broadens the scope of forgery attacks,
presenting a greater challenge to the security of current watermarking
techniques for diffusion models and the authority of watermarking schemes in
synthetic data generation and governance.

Conclusion: SVD数据集填补了公开数据集的空白，促进了3D视频相关研究的发展。

Abstract: Stereoscopic video has long been the subject of research due to its capacity
to deliver immersive three-dimensional content across a wide range of
applications, from virtual and augmented reality to advanced human-computer
interaction. The dual-view format inherently provides binocular disparity cues
that enhance depth perception and realism, making it indispensable for fields
such as telepresence, 3D mapping, and robotic vision. Until recently, however,
end-to-end pipelines for capturing, encoding, and viewing high-quality 3D video
were neither widely accessible nor optimized for consumer-grade devices.
Today's smartphones, such as the iPhone Pro, and modern Head-Mounted Displays
(HMDs), like the Apple Vision Pro (AVP), offer built-in support for
stereoscopic video capture, hardware-accelerated encoding, and seamless
playback on devices like the Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3, requiring
minimal user intervention. Apple refers to this streamlined workflow as spatial
video. Making the full stereoscopic video process available to everyone has
made new applications possible. Despite these advances, there remains a notable
absence of publicly available datasets that include the complete spatial video
pipeline.
  In this paper, we introduce SVD, a spatial video dataset comprising 300
five-second video sequences, 150 captured using an iPhone Pro and 150 with an
AVP. Additionally, 10 longer videos with a minimum duration of 2 minutes have
been recorded. The SVD dataset is publicly released under an open-access
license to facilitate research in codec performance evaluation, subjective and
objective quality of experience (QoE) assessment, depth-based computer vision,
stereoscopic video streaming, and other emerging 3D applications such as neural
rendering and volumetric capture. Link to the dataset:

Abstract: Abstract interpretation offers a powerful toolset for static analysis,
tackling precision, complexity and state-explosion issues. In the literature,
state partitioning abstractions based on (bi)simulation and property-preserving
state relations have been successfully applied to abstract model checking.
Here, we pursue a different track in which model checking is seen as an
instance of program verification. To this purpose, we introduce a suitable
language-called MOKA (for MOdel checking as abstract interpretation of Kleene
Algebras)-which is used to encode temporal formulae as programs. In particular,
we show that (universal fragments of) temporal logics, such as ACTL or, more
generally, universal mu-calculus can be transformed into MOKA programs. Such
programs return all and only the initial states which violate the formula. By
applying abstract interpretation to MOKA programs, we pave the way for reusing
more general abstractions than partitions as well as for tuning the precision
of the abstraction to remove or avoid false alarms. We show how to perform
model checking via a program logic that combines under-approximation and
abstract interpretation analysis to avoid false alarms. The notion of locally
complete abstraction is used to dynamically improve the analysis precision via
counterexample-guided domain refinement.

Abstract: Trace-based properties are the gold standard for program behaviour analysis.
One of the domains of application of this type of analysis is cryptocurrency
ledgers, both for the purpose of analyzing the behaviour of the ledger itself,
and any user-defined programs called by it, known as smart contracts. The
(extended) UTxO ledger model is a kind of ledger model where all smart contract
code is stateless, and additional work must be done to model stateful programs.
We formalize the application of trace-based analysis to UTxO ledgers and
contracts, expressing it in the languages of topology, as well as graph and
category theory. To describe valid traces of UTxO ledger executions, and their
relation to the behaviour of stateful programs implemented on the ledger, we
define a category of simple graphs, infinite paths in which form an
ultra-metric space. Maps in this category are arbitrary partial sieve-define
homomorphisms of simple graphs. Programs implemented on the ledger correspond
to non-expanding maps out of the graph of valid UTxO execution traces. We
reason about safety properties in this framework, and prove properties of valid
UTxO ledger traces.

Abstract: Recently, description logic LE-ALC was introduced for reasoning in the
semantic environment of enriched formal contexts, and a polynomial-time
tableaux algorithm was developed to check the consistency of knowledge bases
with acyclic TBoxes. In this work, we introduce a fuzzy generalization of
LE-ALC called LE-FALC which provides a description logic counterpart of
many-valued normal non-distributive logic a.k.a. many-valued LE-logic. This
description logic can be used to represent and reason about knowledge in the
formal framework of fuzzy formal contexts and fuzzy formal concepts. We provide
a tableaux algorithm that provides a complete and sound polynomial-time
decision procedure to check the consistency of LE-FALC ABoxes. As a result, we
also obtain an exponential-time decision procedure for checking the consistency
of LE-FALC with acyclic TBoxes by unraveling.

Abstract: A possible path to the interpretability of neural networks is to
(approximately) represent them in the regional format of piecewise linear
functions, where regions of inputs are associated to linear functions computing
the network outputs. We present an algorithm for the translation of feedforward
neural networks with ReLU activation functions in hidden layers and truncated
identity activation functions in the output layer. We also empirically
investigate the complexity of regional representations outputted by our method
for neural networks with varying sizes. Lattice and logical representations of
neural networks are straightforward from regional representations as long as
they satisfy a specific property. So we empirically investigate to what extent
the translations by our algorithm satisfy such property.

Abstract: Narrowing is a well-known technique that adds to term rewriting mechanisms
the required power to search for solutions to equational problems. Rewriting
and narrowing are well-studied in first-order term languages, but several
problems remain to be investigated when dealing with languages with binders
using nominal techniques. Applications in programming languages and theorem
proving require reasoning modulo alpha-equivalence considering structural
congruences generated by equational axioms, such as commutativity. This paper
presents the first definitions of nominal rewriting and narrowing modulo an
equational theory. We establish a property called nominal E-coherence and
demonstrate its role in identifying normal forms of nominal terms.
Additionally, we prove the nominal E-Lifting theorem, which ensures the
correspondence between sequences of nominal equational rewriting steps and
narrowing, crucial for developing a correct algorithm for nominal equational
unification via nominal equational narrowing. We illustrate our results using
the equational theory for commutativity.

Abstract: Inductive proofs can be represented as proof schemata, i.e. as parameterized
sequences of proofs defined in a primitive recursive way. Applications of proof
schemata can be found in the area of automated proof analysis where the
schemata admit (schematic) cut-elimination and the construction of Herbrand
systems. This work focuses on the expressivity of proof schemata. We show that
proof schemata can simulate primitive recursive arithmetic. The translation of
proofs in arithmetic to proof schemata can be considered as a crucial step in
the analysis of inductive proofs.

paraconsistent Kleene Algebra with tests (PKAT), capable of capturing vague and
contradictory computations. Finally, to establish the semantics of such a
structure, we introduce two algebras parametric on a class of twisted
structures. We believe this sort of structures, for their huge flexibility,

Abstract: Boolean Networks (BNs) serve as a fundamental modeling framework for
capturing complex dynamical systems across various domains, including systems
biology, computational logic, and artificial intelligence. A crucial property
of BNs is the presence of trap spaces -- subspaces of the state space that,
once entered, cannot be exited. Minimal trap spaces, in particular, play a
significant role in analyzing the long-term behavior of BNs, making their
efficient enumeration and counting essential. The fixed points in BNs are a
special case of minimal trap spaces. In this work, we formulate several
meaningful counting problems related to minimal trap spaces and fixed points in
BNs. These problems provide valuable insights both within BN theory (e.g., in
probabilistic reasoning and dynamical analysis) and in broader application
areas, including systems biology, abstract argumentation, and logic
programming. To address these computational challenges, we propose novel
methods based on {\em approximate answer set counting}, leveraging techniques
from answer set programming. Our approach efficiently approximates the number
of minimal trap spaces and the number of fixed points without requiring
exhaustive enumeration, making it particularly well-suited for large-scale BNs.
Our experimental evaluation on an extensive and diverse set of benchmark
instances shows that our methods significantly improve the feasibility of
counting minimal trap spaces and fixed points, paving the way for new
applications in BN analysis and beyond.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了基于数据流而非控制流的运行时监控逻辑的监控性，展示了其与寄存器自动机的联系，并揭示了监控性的严格分层结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了将运行时监控从控制流扩展到数据流，研究了一种扩展逻辑的监控性，以更全面地验证系统行为。

Method: 使用基于无限域的数据变量和谓词的一阶量化扩展逻辑，分析其与寄存器自动机的联系，并开发监控合成算法。

Result: 发现该逻辑的监控性存在严格分层，确定性监控器会限制可监控属性，且无法找到可判定片段捕获所有可监控属性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了数据流逻辑的复杂性，为运行时监控的理论和应用提供了新的理解。

Abstract: Runtime verification, also known as runtime monitoring, consists of checking
whether a system satisfies a given specification by observing the trace it
produces during its execution. It is used as a lightweight verification
technique to complement or substitute costlier methods such as model-checking.
  In the regular setting, Hennessy-Milner logic with recursion, a variant of
the modal mu-calculus, provides a versatile formalism for expressing linear-
and branching-time specifications of the control flow of the system.
  In this paper, we shift the focus from control to data and study the
monitorability of an extension of this logic that allows one to express
properties of the data flow. Data values are modelled as values from an
infinite domain. They are stored using data variables and manipulated using
predicates and first-order quantification.
  The resulting logic is closely related to register automata with guessing.
This correspondence yields a monitor synthesis algorithm, and allows us to
derive a strict monitorability hierarchy between the different fragments of the
logic, in stark contrast to the regular setting. In particular, restricting to
deterministic monitors strictly reduces the set of monitorable properties.
  Last, we exhibit a fragment of the logic that can express all monitorable
formulae in the logic without greatest fixed-points but not in the full logic.
We finally show that this is unavoidable because, in fact, there is no
decidable fragment of the logic that captures all monitorable properties.

Motivation: 旨在为德性逻辑提供一种新的非确定性语义框架，并填补形式不一致性逻辑在德性逻辑领域的应用空白。

Method: 使用交换结构和克里普克模型构建交换克里普克模型，通过N矩阵和RN矩阵对不满足公理(cl)的系统进行分类。

Result: 首次为$C^{D}_n$层次结构提供了完整的公理化和语义，包括历史系统$C^{D}_1$。

Conclusion: 结合交换结构和克里普克模型的方法为德性逻辑提供了新的语义和公理化工具。

Abstract: We present a construction of nondeterministic semantics for some deontic
logics based on the class of paraconsistent logics known as Logics of Formal
Inconsistency (LFIs), for the first time combining swap structures and Kripke
models through the novel notion of swap Kripe models. We start by making use of
Nmatrices to characterize systems based on LFIs that do not satisfy axiom (cl),
while turning to RNmatrices when the latter is considered in the underlying
LFIs. This paper also presents, for the first time, a full axiomatization and a
semantics for the $C^{D}_n$ hierarchy, by use of the aforementioned mixed
semantics with RNmatrices. This includes the historical system $C^{D}_1$ of da
Costa-Carnielli (1986), the first deontic paraconsistent system proposed in the
literature.

TL;DR: QualitEye是一种验证基于图像的眼动数据质量的新方法，通过语义表征保护隐私，适用于公开和隐私保护场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模眼动数据收集中的数据质量和隐私问题是当前研究的挑战。

Method: 采用新的语义表征眼动图像，结合隐私保护集合交集协议，支持公开和隐私保护两种场景。

Result: 在MPIIFaceGaze和GazeCapture数据集上验证性能高，隐私保护版本运行时开销小。

Conclusion: QualitEye为机器学习、人机交互和密码学交叉领域的眼动分析提供了新方法。

Abstract: Gaze-based applications are increasingly advancing with the availability of
large datasets but ensuring data quality presents a substantial challenge when
collecting data at scale. It further requires different parties to collaborate,
therefore, privacy concerns arise. We propose QualitEye--the first method for
verifying image-based gaze data quality. QualitEye employs a new semantic
representation of eye images that contains the information required for
verification while excluding irrelevant information for better domain
adaptation. QualitEye covers a public setting where parties can freely exchange
data and a privacy-preserving setting where parties cannot reveal their raw
data nor derive gaze features/labels of others with adapted private set
intersection protocols. We evaluate QualitEye on the MPIIFaceGaze and
GazeCapture datasets and achieve a high verification performance (with a small
overhead in runtime for privacy-preserving versions). Hence, QualitEye paves
the way for new gaze analysis methods at the intersection of machine learning,
human-computer interaction, and cryptography.

Motivation: 慢性伤口的高发率及其对患者和医疗系统的负担促使开发了这款应用，传统护理方式资源密集且效果有限。

Method: 采用用户为中心的设计方法，结合患者和专家的反馈开发应用，集成深度学习模型进行伤口分割和远程监测。

Result: 可用性研究表明，患者和皮肤科医生认为应用易用、质量高，AI识别功能效果良好。

Conclusion: WoundAIssist为患者和医疗专业人员之间的沟通提供了便捷的解决方案，并总结了远程患者监测应用的设计经验。

Abstract: The rising prevalence of chronic wounds, especially in aging populations,
presents a significant healthcare challenge due to prolonged hospitalizations,
elevated costs, and reduced patient quality of life. Traditional wound care is
resource-intensive, requiring frequent in-person visits that strain both
patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Therefore, we present
WoundAIssist, a patient-centered, AI-driven mobile application designed to
support telemedical wound care. WoundAIssist enables patients to regularly
document wounds at home via photographs and questionnaires, while physicians
remain actively engaged in the care process through remote monitoring and video
consultations. A distinguishing feature is an integrated lightweight deep
learning model for on-device wound segmentation, which, combined with
patient-reported data, enables continuous monitoring of wound healing
progression. Developed through an iterative, user-centered process involving
both patients and domain experts, WoundAIssist prioritizes an user-friendly
design, particularly for elderly patients. A conclusive usability study with
patients and dermatologists reported excellent usability, good app quality, and
favorable perceptions of the AI-driven wound recognition. Our main contribution
is two-fold: (I) the implementation and (II) evaluation of WoundAIssist, an
easy-to-use yet comprehensive telehealth solution designed to bridge the gap
between patients and HCPs. Additionally, we synthesize design insights for
remote patient monitoring apps, derived from over three years of
interdisciplinary research, that may inform the development of similar digital
health tools across clinical domains.

Motivation: 新冠疫情期间，教育模式从线下转为线上，非语言沟通的缺失导致师生沟通效率下降，论文旨在通过情感分析技术弥补这一缺陷。

Method: 研究包括数据准备、特征选择，并开发了一个结合词嵌入、LSTM和注意力机制的深度神经网络模型，与逻辑回归基线模型进行比较。

Result: 模型旨在更准确地理解学生的情感反馈，为教师提供更多非语言沟通的替代方式。

Conclusion: 通过情感分析，研究试图改善在线教育中的师生沟通质量，提升教育体验。

Abstract: During the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the educational paradigm has
experienced a major change from in person learning traditional to online
platforms. The change of learning convention has impacted the teacher-student
especially in non-verbal communication. The absent of non-verbal communication
has led to a reliance on verbal feedback which diminished the efficacy of the
educational experience. This paper explores the integration of sentiment
analysis into learning management systems (LMS) to bridge the student-teacher's
gap by offering an alternative approach to interpreting student feedback beyond
its verbal context. The research involves data preparation, feature selection,
and the development of a deep neural network model encompassing word embedding,
LSTM, and attention mechanisms. This model is compared against a logistic
regression baseline to evaluate its efficacy in understanding student feedback.
The study aims to bridge the communication gap between instructors and students
in online learning environments, offering insights into the emotional context
of student feedback and ultimately improving the quality of online education.

Conclusion: 场景构建方法在计算机科学中具有重要价值，但仍需进一步探索其传统用途以丰富该领域。

Abstract: Scenario building is an established method to anticipate the future of
emerging technologies. Its primary goal is to use narratives to map future
trajectories of technology development and sociotechnical adoption. Following
this process, risks and benefits can be identified early on, and strategies can
be developed that strive for desirable futures. In recent years, computer
science has adopted this method and applied it to various technologies,
including Artificial Intelligence (AI). Because computing technologies play
such an important role in shaping modern societies, it is worth exploring how
scenarios are being used as an anticipatory tool in the field -- and what
possible traditional uses of scenarios are not yet covered but have the
potential to enrich the field. We address this gap by conducting a systematic
literature review on the use of scenario building methods in computer science
over the last decade (n = 59). We guide the review along two main questions.
First, we aim to uncover how scenarios are used in computing literature,
focusing especially on the rationale for why scenarios are used. Second, in
following the potential of scenario building to enhance inclusivity in
research, we dive deeper into the participatory element of the existing
scenario building literature in computer science.

Result: 用户研究表明，模块化和个性化设计能有效提升多模态触觉界面的表现，适应动态交互需求。

Conclusion: 模块化和个性化设计为动态人机交互中的触觉界面提供了灵活性，推动了可重构系统的发展。

Abstract: We present a customizable soft haptic system that integrates modular hardware
with an information-theoretic algorithm to personalize feedback for different
users and tasks. Our platform features modular, multi-degree-of-freedom
pneumatic displays, where different signal types, such as pressure, frequency,
and contact area, can be activated or combined using fluidic logic circuits.
These circuits simplify control by reducing reliance on specialized electronics
and enabling coordinated actuation of multiple haptic elements through a
compact set of inputs. Our approach allows rapid reconfiguration of haptic
signal rendering through hardware-level logic switching without rewriting code.
Personalization of the haptic interface is achieved through the combination of
modular hardware and software-driven signal selection. To determine which
display configurations will be most effective, we model haptic communication as
a signal transmission problem, where an agent must convey latent information to
the user. We formulate the optimization problem to identify the haptic hardware
setup that maximizes the information transfer between the intended message and
the user's interpretation, accounting for individual differences in
sensitivity, preferences, and perceptual salience. We evaluate this framework
through user studies where participants interact with reconfigurable displays
under different signal combinations. Our findings support the role of
modularity and personalization in creating multimodal haptic interfaces and
advance the development of reconfigurable systems that adapt with users in
dynamic human-machine interaction contexts.

personalizing assistance through collaboration with older adults with MCI and
their care partners. We concluded our findings in three key
contexts--routine-based, real-time, and situational--that informed strategies
for designing context-aware meal prep assistance tailored to users' needs. Our
results provide actionable insights for creating technologies to assist meal
preparation that are personalized for the unique lifestyles of older adults
with MCI, situated in the complex and dynamic homebound context, and respecting

Motivation: 随着AI系统在社会中的广泛应用，其带来的伤害问题日益受到关注。然而，关于伤害发生后的修复行动（如责任归属、补救措施等）研究较少，亟需系统性的分类和分析。

Method: 通过对真实世界中AI相关事件的专题分析，开发了一套AI伤害修复的分类法，并将其应用于1,060起事件的统计分析。

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are integrated into more aspects of
society, they offer new capabilities but also cause a range of harms that are
drawing increasing scrutiny. A large body of work in the Responsible AI
community has focused on identifying and auditing these harms. However, much
less is understood about what happens after harm occurs: what constitutes
reparation, who initiates it, and how effective these reparations are. In this
paper, we develop a taxonomy of AI harm reparation based on a thematic analysis
of real-world incidents. The taxonomy organizes reparative actions into four
overarching goals: acknowledging harm, attributing responsibility, providing
remedies, and enabling systemic change. We apply this framework to a dataset of
1,060 AI-related incidents, analyzing the prevalence of each action and the
distribution of stakeholder involvement. Our findings show that reparation
efforts are concentrated in early, symbolic stages, with limited actions toward
accountability or structural reform. Drawing on theories of justice, we argue
that existing responses fall short of delivering meaningful redress. This work
contributes a foundation for advancing more accountable and reparative
approaches to Responsible AI.

Abstract: Earable devices, wearables positioned in or around the ear, are undergoing a
rapid transformation from audio-centric accessories into multifunctional
systems for interaction, contextual awareness, and health monitoring. This
evolution is driven by commercial trends emphasizing sensor integration and by
a surge of academic interest exploring novel sensing capabilities. Building on
the foundation established by earlier surveys, this work presents a timely and
comprehensive review of earable research published since 2022. We analyze over
one hundred recent studies to characterize this shifting research landscape,
identify emerging applications and sensing modalities, and assess progress
relative to prior efforts. In doing so, we address three core questions: how
has earable research evolved in recent years, what enabling resources are now
available, and what opportunities remain for future exploration. Through this
survey, we aim to provide both a retrospective and forward-looking view of
earable technology as a rapidly expanding frontier in ubiquitous computing. In
particular, this review reveals that over the past three years, researchers
have discovered a variety of novel sensing principles, developed many new
earable sensing applications, enhanced the accuracy of existing sensing tasks,
and created substantial new resources to advance research in the field. Based
on this, we further discuss open challenges and propose future directions for
the next phase of earable research.

Motivation: 联合注意力是早期社会沟通发展的关键指标，但家长难以在没有专家指导的情况下评估。如何通过技术手段模拟SLPs的专业分析是研究的出发点。

Method: 通过深入访谈和视频标注研究，提取SLPs评估联合注意力的三大行为线索（凝视、动作、发声），开发两阶段MLLM系统：1) 从视频提取细粒度行为描述；2) 使用专家对齐提示判断联合注意力质量。

Result: 在26个家长-儿童互动视频中，MLLM在行为线索提取上达到85%准确率，模拟专家判断的平均精度超过75%。

Conclusion: 研究表明MLLMs可以对齐SLPs的观察与判断，为家长-儿童互动分析提供技术支持，并提出设计指南（行为线索结构化、范例库构建、个性化响应）。

Abstract: Joint attention is a critical marker of early social-communicative
development, yet remains difficult for caregivers to assess without expert
guidance. In this work, we explore how multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
can be aligned with the reasoning processes of speech-language pathologists
(SLPs) to support the interpretation of everyday parent-child interactions. We
conducted in-depth interviews and video annotation studies with three
experienced SLPs to uncover how they evaluate joint attention based on three
core behavioural cues: gaze, action, and vocalisation. Using these insights, we
developed a two-stage MLLM-based system that first extracts fine-grained
behavioural descriptions from video segments and then judge joint attention
quality using expert-aligned prompts. Our evaluation across 26 parent-child
interaction videos shows that MLLMs can achieve up to 85% accuracy in
perceptual cue extraction and over 75% average precision in simulating expert
judgement. We further propose design guidelines for building MLLM-based
behaviour observation-judgement systems that align with SLPs, emphasising the
structuring of behavioural cues, the construction of exemplar libraries
grounded in expert annotations, and the need to personalise system responses
based on developmental stage and neurotypical or atypical presentation. This
work provides structured behavioural cues derived from SLP expertise,
demonstrates the feasibility of aligning SLPs observation and judgement using
MLLMs, and offers practical design guidelines for building aligned systems to
support parent-child interaction analysis.

### [47] [The Turn to Practice in Design Ethics: Characteristics and Future Research Directions for HCI Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06055)
*Gizem Öz,Christian Dindler,Sharon Lindberg*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 综述探讨了设计伦理在实践中的动态性，提出其是一个不断演变的情境化过程，并提出了未来研究的六个方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着新兴技术对社会的影响日益显著，研究者在日常工作中更好地捕捉伦理考量的复杂性显得尤为重要。

Method: 基于HCI领域对实践的关注，综述分析了设计伦理研究的动机、概念框架、方法论及其贡献。

Result: 研究发现，设计伦理逐渐从静态抽象的框架转向动态、情境化且协作发展的研究方向。

Conclusion: HCI研究因其丰富的实践导向经验，有望引领跨领域的设计伦理研究发展。

Abstract: As emerging technologies continue to shape society, there is a growing
emphasis on the need to engage with design ethics as it unfolds in practice to
better capture the complexities of ethical considerations embedded in
day-to-day work. Positioned within the broader "turn to practice" in HCI, the
review characterizes this body of work in terms of its motivations, conceptual
frameworks, methodologies, and contributions across a range of design
disciplines and academic databases. The findings reveal a shift away from
static and abstract ethical frameworks toward an understanding of ethics as an
evolving, situated, and inherent aspect of design activities, one that can be
cultivated and fostered collaboratively. This review proposes six future
directions for establishing common research priorities and fostering the
field's growth. While the review promotes cross-disciplinary dialogue, we argue
that HCI research, given its cumulative experience with practice-oriented
research, is well-equipped to guide this emerging strand of work on design
ethics.

*Ruochen Ji,Lyu Tiangang*

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合语音输入、手势识别和多代理大语言模型的混合现实界面，以支持直观的参数化建模，降低设计任务的认知和操作障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决混合现实中参数化建模的精度限制和输入方式不足的问题，支持非编程背景的设计师进行设计。

Method: 开发了结合语音、手势和LLM的对话式MR界面，动态管理参数状态并通过对话解析模糊指令。

Result: 系统在沉浸式环境中实现了实时模型操作，降低了早期设计任务的认知和操作障碍。

Conclusion: 该工作扩展了混合现实在生成式设计平台中的作用，通过自然的交互支持程序化思维。

Abstract: Mixed reality (MR) environments offer embodied spatial interaction, providing
intuitive 3D manipulation capabilities that enhance the conceptual design
process. Parametric modeling, a powerful and advanced architectural design
method, enables the generation of complex, optimized geometries. However, its
integration into MR environments remains limited due to precision constraints
and unsuitable input modalities. Existing MR tools prioritize spatial
interaction but lack the control and expressiveness required for parametric
workflows, particularly for designers without formal programming backgrounds.
We address this gap by introducing a novel conversational MR interface that
combines speech input, gesture recognition, and a multi-agent large language
model (LLM) system to support intuitive parametric modeling. Our system
dynamically manages parameter states, resolves ambiguous commands through
conversation and contextual prompting, and enables real-time model manipulation
within immersive environments. We demonstrate how this approach reduces
cognitive and operational barriers in early-stage design tasks, allowing users
to refine and explore their design space. This work expands the role of MR to a
generative design platform, supporting programmatic thinking in design tasks
through natural, embodied interaction.

### [49] [A Novel, Human-in-the-Loop Computational Grounded Theory Framework for Big Social Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06083)
*Lama Alqazlan,Zheng Fang,Michael Castelle,Rob Procter*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合人类干预的计算方法论（CGT），以解决大数据背景下定性研究中的可扩展性和可信度问题，并在实际研究中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大数据时代，传统定性研究方法因人工工作量大而难以扩展，计算方法的引入虽能解决可扩展性问题，但结果的可信度成为研究者的主要担忧。

Method: 提出了一种名为'计算扎根理论（CGT）'的新框架，结合'人在循环中'方法，利用ML和NLP工具分析大型定性数据集，同时保持传统GT方法的严谨性。

Result: 该方法在分析Reddit上关于零工经济中导师体验的数据集时表现出色，验证了其可行性和有效性。

Conclusion: CGT框架为大规模定性数据分析提供了可信且高效的方法，既利用了计算工具的优势，又保留了人类研究的严谨性。

Abstract: The availability of big data has significantly influenced the possibilities
and methodological choices for conducting large-scale behavioural and social
science research. In the context of qualitative data analysis, a major
challenge is that conventional methods require intensive manual labour and are
often impractical to apply to large datasets. One effective way to address this
issue is by integrating emerging computational methods to overcome scalability
limitations. However, a critical concern for researchers is the trustworthiness
of results when Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools are used to analyse such data. We argue that confidence in the
credibility and robustness of results depends on adopting a 'human-in-the-loop'
methodology that is able to provide researchers with control over the
analytical process, while retaining the benefits of using ML and NLP. With this
in mind, we propose a novel methodological framework for Computational Grounded
Theory (CGT) that supports the analysis of large qualitative datasets, while
maintaining the rigour of established Grounded Theory (GT) methodologies. To
illustrate the framework's value, we present the results of testing it on a
dataset collected from Reddit in a study aimed at understanding tutors'
experiences in the gig economy.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: sQRy技术通过在QR码中嵌入可运行程序实现无网络交互，本文提出优化字符串占用空间的策略以增强其应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: sQRy技术因字符串占用空间过大限制了程序长度，需优化以拓展应用范围。

Method: 提出一种简单有效的策略减少字符串空间占用。

Result: 优化后的sQRy技术能嵌入更长程序，提升实用性。

Conclusion: 通过减少字符串空间占用，sQRy技术的适用性得到显著扩展。

Abstract: Executable QR codes, or sQRy, is a technology dated 2022 that permits to
include a runnable program inside a QR code, enabling interaction with the user
even in the absence of an Internet connection. sQRy are enablers for different
practical applications, including network equipment configuration, diagnostics,
and enhanced smart manuals in industrial contexts. Many other
non-industry-related fields can also benefit from this technology. Regardless
of where sQRy are used, text strings are among the most commonly embedded data.
However, due to strict limitations on the available payload, the occupancy of
strings limits the length of the programs that can be embedded. In this work,
we propose a simple yet effective strategy that can reduce the space taken by
strings, hence broadening sQRy applicability.

Motivation: 21世纪需求复杂性要求培养综合能力，但课堂学习与个性化评估间存在差距，AI角色可能弥合这一差距。

Method: 采用混合方法，通过问卷调查和定性分析，研究56名高中生对AI角色的信任、社交存在感和有效性的感知，并使用PLS-SEM分析关系。

Result: 学生信任影响社交存在感，进而提升感知有效性；材料可信度和学习目标一致性是信任的关键因素。

Conclusion: AI角色在SBA中具有潜力，信任和社交存在感是促进其有效性的关键因素。

Abstract: While the complexity of 21st-century demands has promoted pedagogical
approaches to foster complex competencies, a persistent gap remains between
in-class learning activities and individualized learning or assessment
practices. To address this, studies have explored the use of AI-generated
characters in learning and assessment. One attempt is scenario-based assessment
(SBA), a technique that not only measures but also fosters the development of
competencies throughout the assessment process. SBA introduces simulated agents
to provide an authentic social-interactional context, allowing for the
assessment of competency-based constructs while mitigating the unpredictability
of real-life interactions. Recent advancements in multimodal AI, such as
text-to-video technology, allow these agents to be enhanced into AI-generated
characters. This mixed-method study investigates how learners perceive AI
characters taking the role of mentor and teammates in an SBA mirroring the
context of a collaborative science investigation. Specifically, we examined the
Likert scale responses of 56 high schoolers regarding trust, social presence,
and effectiveness. We analyzed the relationships between these factors and
their impact on the intention to adopt AI characters through PLS-SEM. Our
findings indicated that learners' trust shaped their sense of social presence
with the AI characters, enhancing perceived effectiveness. Qualitative analysis
further highlighted factors that foster trust, such as material credibility and
alignment with learning goals, as well as the pivotal role of social presence
in creating a collaborative context.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI普及，需为老年人等弱势群体提供相关知识，以理解其益处与风险。

Method: 混合方法研究，通过聊天机器人Litti评估其效果，结合定量与定性数据分析。

Result: 定量显示AI素养有改善趋势但不显著；定性显示学习兴趣浓厚，但信任感和安全感未显著提升。

Conclusion: 设计针对老年人的AI教育存在挑战与机遇，需进一步优化策略。

Abstract: As generative AI (GenAI) becomes increasingly widespread, it is crucial to
equip users, particularly vulnerable populations such as older adults (65 and
older), with the knowledge to understand its benefits and potential risks.
Older adults often exhibit greater reservations about adopting emerging
technologies and require tailored literacy support. Using a mixed methods
approach, this study examines strategies for delivering GenAI literacy to older
adults through a chatbot named Litti, evaluating its impact on their AI
literacy (knowledge, safety, and ethical use). The quantitative data indicated
a trend toward improved AI literacy, though the results were not statistically
significant. However, qualitative interviews revealed diverse levels of
familiarity with generative AI and a strong desire to learn more. Findings also
show that while Litti provided a positive learning experience, it did not
significantly enhance participants' trust or sense of safety regarding GenAI.
This exploratory case study highlights the challenges and opportunities in
designing AI literacy education for the rapidly growing older adult population.

TL;DR: ODE-GS结合3D高斯喷射与潜在神经常微分方程（ODEs），实现动态3D场景的远时间预测，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染系统（如NeRF或3DGS）直接嵌入时间信息，擅长插值但无法预测未来（时间超出训练分布）。ODE-GS旨在解决这一限制。

Method: ODE-GS冻结训练窗口内的时间条件变形模型，训练Transformer编码器总结高斯轨迹为潜在状态，通过神经ODE控制其演化，实现连续时间预测。

Result: 在D-NeRF和NVFI基准测试中，ODE-GS的PSNR提升高达10 dB，LPIPS误差减半，达到最优外推性能。

Conclusion: ODE-GS通过连续时间潜在动态，为复杂3D场景的逼真预测提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with
latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D
scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering
systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation
network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict
the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS
eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned
deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer
encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose
continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this
latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can
be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a
variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS
attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving
PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the
strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent
dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of
complex 3D scenes.

Abstract: Intraoperative navigation relies heavily on precise 3D reconstruction to
ensure accuracy and safety during surgical procedures. However, endoscopic

enabling the detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and other critical
features, SurGSplat provides surgeons with enhanced visual clarity,
facilitating precise intraoperative decision-making. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that SurGSplat achieves superior performance in both novel view
synthesis (NVS) and pose estimation accuracy, establishing it as a

Result: 生成了高度多样且逼真的人类序列和大型体育合成数据集，无需手动建模或场景设计。

Conclusion: Gen4D和SportPAL为野外人类中心视觉任务提供了可扩展的合成数据基础。

Abstract: Lack of input data for in-the-wild activities often results in low
performance across various computer vision tasks. This challenge is
particularly pronounced in uncommon human-centric domains like sports, where
real-world data collection is complex and impractical. While synthetic datasets
offer a promising alternative, existing approaches typically suffer from
limited diversity in human appearance, motion, and scene composition due to
their reliance on rigid asset libraries and hand-crafted rendering pipelines.
To address this, we introduce Gen4D, a fully automated pipeline for generating
diverse and photorealistic 4D human animations. Gen4D integrates expert-driven
motion encoding, prompt-guided avatar generation using diffusion-based Gaussian
splatting, and human-aware background synthesis to produce highly varied and
lifelike human sequences. Based on Gen4D, we present SportPAL, a large-scale
synthetic dataset spanning three sports: baseball, icehockey, and soccer.
Together, Gen4D and SportPAL provide a scalable foundation for constructing
synthetic datasets tailored to in-the-wild human-centric vision tasks, with no
need for manual 3D modeling or scene design.

Result: 实验表明IGSM显著缩小剪枝与密集模型性能差距，提升样本质量。

Conclusion: IGSM为通用微调框架，适用于不同架构的扩散模型，有效提升剪枝模型的生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve realistic outcomes across a wide range of generative
tasks, but their high computational cost remains a major barrier to deployment.
Model pruning has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce inference cost and
enable lightweight diffusion models. While effective, pruned diffusion models
are proned to quality reduction due to limited capacity. A key limitation of
current pruning approaches is that pruned models are finetuned using the same
objective as the dense model, typically denoising score matching (DSM). Since
the dense model is accessible during finetuning, it warrants a more effective
approach for knowledge transfer from the dense to the pruned model. Motivated
by this aim, we revisit the finetuning stage and propose IGSM
(\textbf{I}mproved \textbf{G}eometric and \textbf{S}ensitivity
\textbf{M}atching), a general-purpose finetuning framework that introduces a
second-order Jacobian projection loss inspired by Finite-Time Lyapunov
Exponents (FTLE). IGSM efficiently captures and aligns the geometric and the
temporal dynamics of pruned models with their dense teachers using scalable
second-order projections. Our approach is architecture-agnostic and applies to
both U-Net- and Transformer-based diffusion models. Experiments on CIFAR-10,
CelebA, LSUN-Church, and LSUN-Bedroom show that IGSM consistently narrows the
performance gap between pruned and dense models, substantially improving sample
quality. Code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/FATE4869/IGSM-Official

Result: 该方法可在现代GPU上实现高效实时渲染，并可与其他技术（如ReSTIR）无缝集成。

Conclusion: 神经缓存提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案，适用于多光源直接光照的实时计算。

Abstract: Direct illumination with many lights is an inherent component of
physically-based rendering, remaining challenging, especially in real-time
scenarios. We propose an online-trained neural cache that stores visibility
between lights and 3D positions. We feed light visibility to weighted reservoir
sampling (WRS) to sample a light source. The cache is implemented as a
fully-fused multilayer perceptron (MLP) with multi-resolution hash-grid
encoding, enabling online training and efficient inference on modern GPUs in
real-time frame rates. The cache can be seamlessly integrated into existing

Abstract: In this work, we present an extension to the neural texture compression
method of Weinreich and colleagues [2024]. Like them, we leverage existing
block compression methods which permit to use hardware texture filtering to
store a neural representation of physically-based rendering (PBR) texture sets
(including albedo, normal maps, roughness, etc.). However, we show that low
dynamic range block compression formats still make the solution viable. Thanks
to this, we show that we can achieve higher compression ratio or higher quality
at fixed compression ratio. We improve performance at runtime using a tile
based rendering architecture that leverage hardware matrix multiplication
engine. Thanks to all this, we render 4k textures sets (9 channels per asset)
with anisotropic filtering at 1080p using only 28MB of VRAM per texture set at
0.55ms on an Intel B580.

Motivation: 随着推理扩展到多节点部署，分解成为提升吞吐量与交互性权衡的重要路径，但实际部署仍面临优化空间复杂性和系统协调的挑战。

Method: 对分布式推理进行首次系统研究，评估了数十万个设计点，涵盖多样工作负载和硬件配置。

Conclusion: 研究结果为高效分解部署提供了可操作的见解，帮助平衡系统吞吐量与交互性。

Abstract: As inference scales to multi-node deployments, disaggregation - splitting
inference into distinct phases - offers a promising path to improving the
throughput-interactivity Pareto frontier. Despite growing enthusiasm and a
surge of open-source efforts, practical deployment of disaggregated serving
remains limited due to the complexity of the optimization search space and
system-level coordination. In this paper, we present the first systematic study
of disaggregated inference at scale, evaluating hundreds of thousands of design
points across diverse workloads and hardware configurations. We find that
disaggregation is most effective for prefill-heavy traffic patterns and larger
models. Our results highlight the critical role of dynamic rate matching and
elastic scaling in achieving Pareto-optimal performance. Our findings offer
actionable insights for efficient disaggregated deployments to navigate the
trade-off between system throughput and interactivity.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SecureSmart HPA 是一种增强型水平 Pod 自动扩展器，通过监测资源需求、检测中断、动态调整扩展决策，解决传统 HPA 在资源浪费和服务不可用方面的不足，并在资源受限环境中优化扩展效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 HPA 无法有效应对故障、网络攻击和维护等操作挑战导致的资源中断，导致资源浪费和服务不可用，因此需要一种更弹性和资源高效的自动扩展解决方案。

Method: SecureSmart HPA 扩展了 Smart HPA，通过监测资源需求、检测中断、评估资源浪费并动态调整扩展决策，同时支持微服务间的资源共享。

Result: 在不同中断严重程度（25%、50%、75% 资源浪费）下，SecureSmart HPA 能减少 57.2% 的 CPU 过度使用，并将资源分配提升 51.1%，显著优于 Smart HPA。

Conclusion: SecureSmart HPA 在波动和资源受限的环境中表现出色，能够提供弹性和高效的自动扩展操作。

Abstract: Horizontal Pod Auto-scalers (HPAs) are crucial for managing resource
allocation in microservice architectures to handle fluctuating workloads.
However, traditional HPAs fail to address resource disruptions caused by
faults, cyberattacks, maintenance, and other operational challenges. These
disruptions result in resource wastage, service unavailability, and HPA
performance degradation. To address these challenges, we extend our prior work
on Smart HPA and propose SecureSmart HPA, which offers resilient and
resource-efficient auto-scaling for microservice architectures. SecureSmart HPA
monitors microservice resource demands, detects disruptions, evaluates resource
wastage, and dynamically adjusts scaling decisions to enhance the resilience of
auto-scaling operations. Furthermore, SecureSmart HPA enables resource sharing
among microservices, optimizing scaling efficiency in resource-constrained
environments. Experimental evaluation at varying disruption severities, with
25%, 50%, and 75% resource wastage, demonstrates that SecureSmart HPA performs
effectively across different levels of disruptions. It achieves up to a 57.2%
reduction in CPU overutilization and a 51.1% increase in resource allocation
compared to Smart HPA, highlighting its ability to deliver resilient and
efficient auto-scaling operations in volatile and resource-constrained
environments.

Result: 通过对不同网络中恶意节点检测方法的比较，论文总结了现有技术的优缺点及其对网络性能的影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调了恶意节点检测在无线多跳网络中的重要性，并指出了未来研究的可能方向。

Abstract: Wireless communication provides great advantages that are not available
through their wired counterparts such as flexibility, ease of deployment and
use, cost reductions, and convenience. Wireless multi-hop networks (WMN) do not
have any centralized management infrastructure. Wireless multi-hop networks
have many benefits since proposed. In such networks when a node wants to send a
packet to a destination where is not in the transmission range, depend on some
intermediate nodes. In this type of networks packet sending is in the form of
multiple hop until destination and this work is dynamic. Lack of centralized
management cause that some nodes show malicious function. Malicious nodes are
that receive packets and drop them maliciously. These malicious nodes could
have many reasons such as hardware failure, software failure or lack of power.
Such nodes make multiple packets drop from the network and the performance of
network strongly decreases. As a result, the throughput of the network
decrease, increase end-to-end delay and increase overhead. Therefore, we must
aware from presence of malicious node in the network and do routing based on
this awareness. Therefore, this paper aims to study and review the present
malicious node detection methods that proposed in literatures. We categorized
networks in groups, including ad hoc networks, MANET, DTN, Opportunistic
networks, WSN, VANET and other wireless networks and compare malicious node

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在通信受限的分布式网络中，如何高效计算完美匹配问题，尤其是在节点间只能通过脉冲通信的场景下。

Method: 提出随机算法和确定性算法，分别在端口编号模型和KT_1假设下设计，并通过递归应用优化时间复杂度和脉冲复杂度。

Result: 随机算法在端口编号模型中实现了$O( \log n )$轮和$O( n\log n )$脉冲复杂度；确定性算法在KT_1假设下进一步优化了性能。

Conclusion: 随机性在端口编号模型中至关重要，而KT_1假设显著提升了确定性算法的表现，为分布式网络中的高效计算提供了新思路。

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing a perfect matching problem in a
synchronous distributed network, where the network topology corresponds to a
complete bipartite graph. The communication between nodes is restricted to
activating communication links, which means that instead of sending messages
containing a number of bits, each node can only send a pulse over some of its
incident links in each round. In the port numbering model, where nodes are
unaware of their neighbor's IDs, we give a randomized algorithm that terminates
in $O( \log n )$ rounds and has a pulse complexity of $O( n\log n )$, which
corresponds to the number of pulses sent over all links. We also show that
randomness is crucial in the port numbering model, as any deterministic
algorithm must send at least $\Omega( n^2 )$ messages in the standard LOCAL
model, where the messages can be of unbounded size. Then, we turn our attention
to the KT_1 assumption, where each node starts out knowing its neighbors' IDs.
We show that this additional knowledge enables significantly improved bounds
even for deterministic algorithms. First, we give an $O( \log n )$ time
deterministic algorithm that sends only $O( n )$ pulses. Finally, we apply this
algorithm recursively to obtain an exponential reduction in the time complexity
to $O( \log^*n\log\log n )$, while slightly increasing the pulse complexity to
$O( n\log^*n )$. All our bounds also hold in the standard CONGEST model with
single-bit messages.

Motivation: 探索利用预训练的LLM嵌入指导SQL查询执行，避免额外训练模型，提供更高效的数据库查询优化方案。

Method: 提出LLM-PM框架，通过嵌入查询的默认执行计划，寻找其最近邻的历史执行计划，并基于邻域投票推荐数据库提示集。辅以轻量级一致性检查和回退机制。

Result: 在JOB-CEB基准测试中，使用OpenGauss实现了查询延迟平均降低21%。

Conclusion: 展示了基于LLM嵌入的无训练优化器指导系统的潜力，为查询性能提升提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) embeddings offer a promising new avenue for
database query optimization. In this paper, we explore how pre-trained
execution plan embeddings can guide SQL query execution without the need for
additional model training. We introduce LLM-PM (LLM-based Plan Mapping), a
framework that embeds the default execution plan of a query, finds its k
nearest neighbors among previously executed plans, and recommends database
hintsets based on neighborhood voting. A lightweight consistency check
validates the selected hint, while a fallback mechanism searches the full hint
space when needed. Evaluated on the JOB-CEB benchmark using OpenGauss, LLM-PM
achieves an average speed-up of 21% query latency reduction. This work
highlights the potential of LLM-powered embeddings to deliver practical
improvements in query performance and opens new directions for training-free,
embedding-based optimizer guidance systems.

Motivation: 现有数据质量方法无法满足流数据的实时性和上下文感知需求，亟需一种专门针对无界流数据的质量监测模型。

Method: 设计了流优先的数据质量监测模型，包括动态约束适应和连续评估机制，并开发了开源框架Stream DaQ来实现模型。

Result: Stream DaQ在性能上显著优于生产级替代方案，并通过原生流功能提供更丰富的功能。

Conclusion: 论文通过Stream DaQ为数据科学社区提供了无缝集成的连续质量监测工具，填补了流数据质量监测的空白。

Abstract: Data quality is fundamental to modern data science workflows, where data
continuously flows as unbounded streams feeding critical downstream tasks, from
elementary analytics to advanced artificial intelligence models. Existing data
quality approaches either focus exclusively on static data or treat streaming
as an extension of batch processing, lacking the temporal granularity and
contextual awareness required for true streaming applications. In this paper,
we present a novel data quality monitoring model specifically designed for
unbounded data streams. Our model introduces stream-first concepts, such as
configurable windowing mechanisms, dynamic constraint adaptation, and
continuous assessment that produces quality meta-streams for real-time pipeline
awareness. To demonstrate practical applicability, we developed Stream DaQ, an
open-source Python framework that implements our theoretical model. Stream DaQ
unifies and adapts over 30 quality checks fragmented across existing static
tools into a comprehensive streaming suite, enabling practitioners to define
sophisticated, context-aware quality constraints through compositional
expressiveness. Our evaluation demonstrates that the model's implementation
significantly outperforms a production-grade alternative in both execution time
and throughput while offering richer functionality via native streaming
capabilities compared to other choices. Through its Python-native design,
Stream DaQ seamlessly integrates with modern data science workflows, making
continuous quality monitoring accessible to the broader data science community.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: ScaleRTL是一个首个用于RTL编码的推理LLM，通过高质量的数据和推理能力显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在RTL代码生成中效果有限，主要原因是缺乏高质量的训练数据和推理能力不足。

Method: 通过构建包含3.5B token的多样链式推理数据集，并采用微调通用推理模型的方法开发了ScaleRTL，同时提出了一种测试时扩展策略来优化推理过程。

Result: ScaleRTL在VerilogEval和RTLLM上表现优异，分别优于18个竞争基线18.4%和12.7%。

Conclusion: ScaleRTL通过高质量数据和推理能力解决了RTL生成的瓶颈，并展示了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled near-human
performance on software coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness in RTL code
generation remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality training data.
While prior efforts have fine-tuned LLMs for RTL tasks, they do not
fundamentally overcome the data bottleneck and lack support for test-time
scaling due to their non-reasoning nature. In this work, we introduce ScaleRTL,
the first reasoning LLM for RTL coding that scales up both high-quality
reasoning data and test-time compute. Specifically, we curate a diverse set of
long chain-of-thought reasoning traces averaging 56K tokens each, resulting in
a dataset of 3.5B tokens that captures rich RTL knowledge. Fine-tuning a
general-purpose reasoning model on this corpus yields ScaleRTL that is capable
of deep RTL reasoning. Subsequently, we further enhance the performance of
ScaleRTL through a novel test-time scaling strategy that extends the reasoning
process via iteratively reflecting on and self-correcting previous reasoning
steps. Experimental results show that ScaleRTL achieves state-of-the-art
performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, outperforming 18 competitive baselines by
up to 18.4% on VerilogEval and 12.7% on RTLLM.

Method: 提出S^2算法利用时间相干性减少计算开销，RC机制降低光栅化频率，配合LuminCore加速器优化缓存查找。

Result: 在移动Volta GPU上实现了4.5倍速度提升和5.3倍能耗降低，质量损失极低（PSNR下降<0.2 dB）。

Conclusion: Lumina通过软硬件协同设计，显著优化了3DGS的效率和性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has vastly advanced the pace of neural
rendering, but it remains computationally demanding on today's mobile SoCs. To
address this challenge, we propose Lumina, a hardware-algorithm co-designed
system, which integrates two principal optimizations: a novel algorithm, S^2,
and a radiance caching mechanism, RC, to improve the efficiency of neural
rendering. S2 algorithm exploits temporal coherence in rendering to reduce the
computational overhead, while RC leverages the color integration process of
3DGS to decrease the frequency of intensive rasterization computations. Coupled
with these techniques, we propose an accelerator architecture, LuminCore, to
further accelerate cache lookup and address the fundamental inefficiencies in
Rasterization. We show that Lumina achieves 4.5x speedup and 5.3x energy
reduction against a mobile Volta GPU, with a marginal quality loss (< 0.2 dB
peak signal-to-noise ratio reduction) across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Motivation: 现代基础模型（FMs）通常训练于多模态、多主题的数据集，计算资源消耗大，且对特定任务可能包含冗余知识。

Result: 在图像建模任务中，生成的小型模型性能优于通用条件模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效地为特定任务生成高性能的小型模型，适合资源受限的环境。

Abstract: Modern Foundation Models (FMs) are typically trained on corpora spanning a
wide range of different data modalities, topics and downstream tasks. Utilizing
these models can be very computationally expensive and is out of reach for most
consumer devices. Furthermore, most of the broad FM knowledge may actually be
irrelevant for a specific task at hand. Here we explore a technique for mapping
parameters of a large Transformer to parameters of a smaller specialized model.
By making this transformation task-specific, we aim to capture a narrower scope
of the knowledge needed for performing a specific task by a smaller model. We
study our method on image modeling tasks, showing that performance of generated
models exceeds that of universal conditional models.

Motivation: 现有量化方法大多采用统一或启发式位宽分配，未考虑权重对量化噪声的非均匀敏感性，导致性能下降。

Method: 通过Hessian代理度量敏感性，将位宽分配问题转化为凸优化任务，提出BAQ算法实现自适应位宽分配。

Result: BAQ在相同位宽下比GPTQ降低困惑度高达56倍，适用于125M至30B参数的大模型。

Conclusion: BAQ通过理论分析和实验验证，显著提升了量化效果，且易于集成到现有量化流程中。

Abstract: Post-training model quantization is a widely adopted technique for reducing
the memory and computational costs of large language models (LLMs). However,
most existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments,
failing to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization
noise. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for allocating quantization
bitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy. We make
key assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be
expressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat
formulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose
closed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise
quantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as
the equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed
\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
achieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows
BAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal
overhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,
achieving up to 56$\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large
language models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters. Leveraging our analytical
results derived from solving the optimal bit allocation problem, we also
provide a theoretical explanation for the observed gains. All codes of this

Conclusion: 通过将上下文直接集成到模型架构中，为高效且适应性强的语言建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Transformers excel at text processing,
but their reliance on prompts for specialized behavior introduces computational
overhead. We propose a modification to a Transformer architecture that
eliminates the need for explicit prompts by learning to encode context into the
model's weights. Our Contextually Guided Transformer (CGT) model maintains a
contextual summary at each sequence position, allowing it to update the weights
on the fly based on the preceding context. This approach enables the model to
self-specialize, effectively creating a tailored model for processing
information following a given prefix. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on synthetic in-context learning tasks and language modeling benchmarks.
Furthermore, we introduce techniques for enhancing the interpretability of the
learned contextual representations, drawing connections to Variational
Autoencoders and promoting smoother, more consistent context encoding. This
work offers a novel direction for efficient and adaptable language modeling by
integrating context directly into the model's architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型（SLMs）在表格推理（TR）中存在局限性，尤其是在数值推理和布局适应性方面。为解决这些问题，本文探索了基于程序的TR（P-TR），并提出了一种改进方法。

Method: Table-r1分为两阶段：1）布局变换推断，通过自监督学习提升表格布局的泛化能力；2）混合范式优化，结合Group Relative Policy Optimization和动态回退策略，增强推理一致性。

Result: 实验证明，Table-r1在四个TR基准测试中表现优于所有基于SLM的方法，准确率比基础模型（LLaMA-8B）提升至少15%，且接近LLM的性能。

Conclusion: Table-r1通过创新的方法和动态策略，有效提升了小语言模型在表格推理中的能力，缩小了与大型语言模型的差距。

Abstract: Table reasoning (TR) requires structured reasoning over semi-structured
tabular data and remains challenging, particularly for small language models
(SLMs, e.g., LLaMA-8B) due to their limited capacity compared to large LMs
(LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o). To narrow this gap, we explore program-based TR (P-TR),
which circumvents key limitations of text-based TR (T-TR), notably in numerical
reasoning, by generating executable programs. However, applying P-TR to SLMs
introduces two challenges: (i) vulnerability to heterogeneity in table layouts,
and (ii) inconsistency in reasoning due to limited code generation capability.
We propose Table-r1, a two-stage P-TR method designed for SLMs. Stage 1
introduces an innovative self-supervised learning task, Layout Transformation
Inference, to improve tabular layout generalization from a programmatic view.
Stage 2 adopts a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization,
enhancing P-TR consistency while allowing dynamic fallback to T-TR when needed.
Experiments on four TR benchmarks demonstrate that Table-r1 outperforms all
SLM-based methods, achieving at least a 15% accuracy improvement over the base
model (LLaMA-8B) across all datasets and reaching performance competitive with
LLMs.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs与人类用户的互动中，模型如何通过吸收和强化人类信念，形成一个类似“回声室”的反馈循环，可能导致虚假信念的固化。

Method: 通过基于代理的LLM模拟和真实世界的GPT使用数据，对这一假说进行形式化和实证测试。

Result: 分析发现，新GPT版本发布后，多样性突然且持续地下降，与假设的人类-AI反馈循环一致。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs反馈循环对信念多样性的负面影响，强调了这一问题在AI发展中的重要性。

Abstract: The training and deployment of large language models (LLMs) create a feedback
loop with human users: models learn human beliefs from data, reinforce these
beliefs with generated content, reabsorb the reinforced beliefs, and feed them
back to users again and again. This dynamic resembles an echo chamber. We
hypothesize that this feedback loop entrenches the existing values and beliefs
of users, leading to a loss of diversity and potentially the lock-in of false
beliefs. We formalize this hypothesis and test it empirically with agent-based
LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data. Analysis reveals sudden but
sustained drops in diversity after the release of new GPT iterations,
consistent with the hypothesized human-AI feedback loop. Code and data

Abstract: Autoregressive language models accumulate errors due to their fixed,
irrevocable left-to-right token generation. To address this, we propose a new
sampling method called Resample-Previous-Tokens (RPT). RPT mitigates error
accumulation by iteratively revisiting and potentially replacing tokens in a
window of previously generated text. This method can be integrated into
existing autoregressive models, preserving their next-token-prediction quality
and speed. Fine-tuning a pretrained 8B parameter model with RPT for only 100B
resulted in ~10% relative improvements on reasoning and coding benchmarks

by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all
network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode
different types of information and may thus draw information differently from
the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter
importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data.
This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model,
capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an
output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution
accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how
outputs borrow from training data.

Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly
diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks,
is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally
dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were
primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and
hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced
"Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality,
structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model
performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the
DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately
10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by
extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision
dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets.
Representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog,
the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and
multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we
document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models
against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our
evaluation publicly available.

Abstract: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more
non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large
proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data,
which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification
and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC
applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease
identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative
data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further
complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To
address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a
likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted
geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a
regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent
class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances.
The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by
encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and
improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments
on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and
ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our
loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss
counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in
F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or
computational complexity. Code available at:

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search
(NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation
costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of
predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While
traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the
absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various
ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to
focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS,
the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive
study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three
main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we
assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks
across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss
functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS.
Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting
appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides
meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for
predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的测试时优化方法，用于解决标准不确定性估计技术（如dropout）在区分可靠与不可靠预测时的不足，通过考虑噪声影响生成更可靠的置信度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准不确定性估计技术（如dropout）在区分可靠与不可靠预测时表现不佳，主要由于分类器权重噪声的影响，虽然不影响整体类别预测，但降低了细粒度统计信息的有效性。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的测试时优化方法，通过考虑噪声影响来生成更可靠的置信度估计，并定义一个单调子集选择函数。

Result: 该方法在标准风险指标（如AUSE和AURC）上表现优异，能有效识别训练与测试分布的差异，区分内部分布与外部分布样本，并揭示CNN和ViT分类器在不同视觉数据集上的关键差异。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了不确定性估计的可靠性，同时在识别分布差异和分类器比较方面表现出色。

Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle
to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute
this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall
class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To
address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts
for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates.
This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population
accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and
it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as
AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies
between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates
in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key
differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

Conclusion: 梯度幅度相似性在多任务深度学习的优化过程中起着关键作用，SAM-GS方法有效且可扩展。

Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn
multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general
hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant
challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced
optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient
descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the
multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would
hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge
arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different
magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to
interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient
surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting
gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a
novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery
(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient
magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS
surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order
momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS
on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays
a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the
optimisation of the learning process.

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature,
comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The code is available at

Conclusion: 任务特定的参数映射技术能有效降低计算成本，同时提升小型模型的性能。

Abstract: Modern Foundation Models (FMs) are typically trained on corpora spanning a
wide range of different data modalities, topics and downstream tasks. Utilizing
these models can be very computationally expensive and is out of reach for most
consumer devices. Furthermore, most of the broad FM knowledge may actually be
irrelevant for a specific task at hand. Here we explore a technique for mapping
parameters of a large Transformer to parameters of a smaller specialized model.
By making this transformation task-specific, we aim to capture a narrower scope
of the knowledge needed for performing a specific task by a smaller model. We
study our method on image modeling tasks, showing that performance of generated
models exceeds that of universal conditional models.

Conclusion: BAQ通过优化位宽分配实现了高效的量化效果，理论分析支持实验结果的优越性。

Abstract: Post-training model quantization is a widely adopted technique for reducing
the memory and computational costs of large language models (LLMs). However,
most existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments,
failing to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization
noise. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for allocating quantization
bitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy. We make
key assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be
expressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat
formulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose
closed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise
quantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as
the equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed
\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
achieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows
BAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal
overhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,
achieving up to 56$\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large
language models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters. Leveraging our analytical
results derived from solving the optimal bit allocation problem, we also
provide a theoretical explanation for the observed gains. All codes of this
paper are available at https://github.com/CSU-ModelCompression/BAQ.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Transformers excel at text processing,
but their reliance on prompts for specialized behavior introduces computational
overhead. We propose a modification to a Transformer architecture that
eliminates the need for explicit prompts by learning to encode context into the
model's weights. Our Contextually Guided Transformer (CGT) model maintains a
contextual summary at each sequence position, allowing it to update the weights
on the fly based on the preceding context. This approach enables the model to
self-specialize, effectively creating a tailored model for processing
information following a given prefix. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on synthetic in-context learning tasks and language modeling benchmarks.
Furthermore, we introduce techniques for enhancing the interpretability of the
learned contextual representations, drawing connections to Variational
Autoencoders and promoting smoother, more consistent context encoding. This
work offers a novel direction for efficient and adaptable language modeling by
integrating context directly into the model's architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小语言模型在表格推理任务中因容量限制导致的数值推理和表格布局泛化问题。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段通过自监督学习任务提升表格布局泛化；第二阶段采用混合范式优化程序化推理一致性。

Result: Table-r1在四个基准测试中表现优异，准确率比基础模型（LLaMA-8B）提升至少15%，性能接近大语言模型。

Conclusion: Table-r1有效缩小了SLMs与LLMs在表格推理任务上的差距，为小模型在该领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Table reasoning (TR) requires structured reasoning over semi-structured
tabular data and remains challenging, particularly for small language models
(SLMs, e.g., LLaMA-8B) due to their limited capacity compared to large LMs
(LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o). To narrow this gap, we explore program-based TR (P-TR),
which circumvents key limitations of text-based TR (T-TR), notably in numerical
reasoning, by generating executable programs. However, applying P-TR to SLMs
introduces two challenges: (i) vulnerability to heterogeneity in table layouts,
and (ii) inconsistency in reasoning due to limited code generation capability.
We propose Table-r1, a two-stage P-TR method designed for SLMs. Stage 1
introduces an innovative self-supervised learning task, Layout Transformation
Inference, to improve tabular layout generalization from a programmatic view.
Stage 2 adopts a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization,
enhancing P-TR consistency while allowing dynamic fallback to T-TR when needed.
Experiments on four TR benchmarks demonstrate that Table-r1 outperforms all
SLM-based methods, achieving at least a 15% accuracy improvement over the base
model (LLaMA-8B) across all datasets and reaching performance competitive with
LLMs.

Result: 分析显示新GPT版本发布后观点多样性突然下降，支持反馈循环假设。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了人类与AI互动中的观点固化风险，呼吁关注模型设计的多样性。

Abstract: The training and deployment of large language models (LLMs) create a feedback
loop with human users: models learn human beliefs from data, reinforce these
beliefs with generated content, reabsorb the reinforced beliefs, and feed them
back to users again and again. This dynamic resembles an echo chamber. We
hypothesize that this feedback loop entrenches the existing values and beliefs
of users, leading to a loss of diversity and potentially the lock-in of false
beliefs. We formalize this hypothesis and test it empirically with agent-based
LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data. Analysis reveals sudden but
sustained drops in diversity after the release of new GPT iterations,
consistent with the hypothesized human-AI feedback loop. Code and data

Result: 在推理和代码生成基准测试中，RPT使预训练的8B参数模型在仅100B的微调后相对提升了约10%。

Conclusion: RPT是一种有效减少错误累积且不损失速度或预测质量的采样方法。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models accumulate errors due to their fixed,
irrevocable left-to-right token generation. To address this, we propose a new
sampling method called Resample-Previous-Tokens (RPT). RPT mitigates error
accumulation by iteratively revisiting and potentially replacing tokens in a
window of previously generated text. This method can be integrated into
existing autoregressive models, preserving their next-token-prediction quality
and speed. Fine-tuning a pretrained 8B parameter model with RPT for only 100B
resulted in ~10% relative improvements on reasoning and coding benchmarks
compared to the standard sampling.

Conclusion: 研究为NAS社区中预测器损失函数的设计提供了有意义的指导，推动更高效的性能预测方法发展。

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search
(NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation
costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of
predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While
traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the
absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various
ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to
focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS,
the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive
study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three
main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we
assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks
across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss
functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS.
Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting
appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides
meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for
predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的测试时优化方法，通过考虑分类器权重噪声的影响，提供更可靠的置信度估计，表现优于标准不确定性估计技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如dropout在区分可靠与不可靠预测时表现不佳，主要是由于分类器权重的噪声影响了细粒度统计信息。

Method: 提出一种测试时优化方法，通过消除噪声影响生成单调子集选择函数，从而提升置信度估计的可靠性。

Result: 该方法在标准风险度量（如AUSE和AURC）中表现优异，并能有效识别训练与测试分布差异以及区分内部分布与外部分布样本。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了不确定性估计的可靠性，同时在识别数据集差异和模型比较方面表现出色。

Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle
to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute
this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall
class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To
address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts
for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates.
This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population
accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and
it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as
AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies
between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates
in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key
differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SAM-GS的新型梯度手术方法，通过梯度幅度相似性度量来优化多任务深度学习的训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务深度学习（MTDL）中，任务的梯度可能会冲突，导致训练效果下降，需要一种方法来调整梯度轨迹以优化学习过程。

Method: 引入相似性感知动量梯度手术（SAM-GS），基于梯度幅度相似性度量，结合梯度均衡化和一阶动量的调制来优化梯度聚合。

Result: 实验证明，SAM-GS在合成问题和多任务学习基准测试中表现有效，梯度幅度相似性对学习过程的优化至关重要。

Conclusion: SAM-GS为解决多任务深度学习中的梯度冲突问题提供了一种有效且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn
multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general
hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant
challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced
optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient
descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the
multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would
hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge
arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different
magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to
interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient
surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting
gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a
novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery
(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient
magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS
surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order
momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS
on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays
a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the
optimisation of the learning process.

Result: 在ImageNet和MS-COCO等大规模数据集上验证了SPEC的有效性。

Conclusion: SPEC为嵌入模型的比较和对齐提供了一种可解释且高效的方法。

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature,
comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的GNN因局部归纳偏差无法有效利用图的结构信息（如连通性和环）。PE和PH是改善这一问题的两种方法，但缺乏理论比较。

Method: 通过理论分析比较PE和PH的表达能力，提出PiPE方法，结合两者的特点，提升GNN的表现。

Result: 实验证明PiPE在分子属性预测、图分类和分布外泛化等任务中优于PE和PH。

Conclusion: PiPE是一种更强大的图表示学习方法，为GNN提供了新的设计思路。

Abstract: The local inductive bias of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs)
hampers their ability to exploit key structural information (e.g., connectivity
and cycles). Positional encoding (PE) and Persistent Homology (PH) have emerged
as two promising approaches to mitigate this issue. PE schemes endow GNNs with
location-aware features, while PH methods enhance GNNs with multiresolution
topological features. However, a rigorous theoretical characterization of the
relative merits and shortcomings of PE and PH has remained elusive. We bridge
this gap by establishing that neither paradigm is more expressive than the
other, providing novel constructions where one approach fails but the other
succeeds. Our insights inform the design of a novel learnable method, PiPE
(Persistence-informed Positional Encoding), which is provably more expressive
than both PH and PE. PiPE demonstrates strong performance across a variety of
tasks (e.g., molecule property prediction, graph classification, and
out-of-distribution generalization), thereby advancing the frontiers of graph
representation learning. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于树的集成模型在处理结构化数据时表现出色，但现有加速方法因内存消耗和利用率低而受限。

Method: 提出了一种针对装袋模型的迭代剪枝算法和两种创新的数据放置策略，以优化 CAM 使用。

Result: 实验显示，RETENTION 显著提升了空间效率（最高 207 倍），且精度损失低于 3%。

Conclusion: RETENTION 为基于树的模型加速提供了高效、资源友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Although deep learning has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning
from unstructured data, modern tree-based ensemble models remain superior in
extracting relevant information and learning from structured datasets. While
several efforts have been made to accelerate tree-based models, the inherent
characteristics of the models pose significant challenges for conventional
accelerators. Recent research leveraging content-addressable memory (CAM)
offers a promising solution for accelerating tree-based models, yet existing
designs suffer from excessive memory consumption and low utilization. This work
addresses these challenges by introducing RETENTION, an end-to-end framework
that significantly reduces CAM capacity requirement for tree-based model
inference. We propose an iterative pruning algorithm with a novel pruning
criterion tailored for bagging-based models (e.g., Random Forest), which
minimizes model complexity while ensuring controlled accuracy degradation.
Additionally, we present a tree mapping scheme that incorporates two innovative
data placement strategies to alleviate the memory redundancy caused by the
widespread use of don't care states in CAM. Experimental results show that
implementing the tree mapping scheme alone achieves $1.46\times$ to $21.30
\times$ better space efficiency, while the full RETENTION framework yields
$4.35\times$ to $207.12\times$ improvement with less than 3% accuracy loss.
These results demonstrate that RETENTION is highly effective in reducing CAM
capacity requirement, providing a resource-efficient direction for tree-based
model acceleration.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep generative models has significantly improved
the realism of synthetic media, presenting both opportunities and security
challenges. While deepfake technology has valuable applications in
entertainment and accessibility, it has emerged as a potent vector for
misinformation campaigns, particularly on social media. Existing detection
frameworks struggle to distinguish between benign and adversarially generated
deepfakes engineered to manipulate public perception. To address this
challenge, we introduce SocialDF, a curated dataset reflecting real-world
deepfake challenges on social media platforms. This dataset encompasses
high-fidelity deepfakes sourced from various online ecosystems, ensuring broad
coverage of manipulative techniques. We propose a novel LLM-based multi-factor
detection approach that combines facial recognition, automated speech
transcription, and a multi-agent LLM pipeline to cross-verify audio-visual
cues. Our methodology emphasizes robust, multi-modal verification techniques
that incorporate linguistic, behavioral, and contextual analysis to effectively
discern synthetic media from authentic content.

Motivation: 现有的联邦微调方法在处理分布式环境中的灾难性遗忘和数据异构性时表现不足，需要一种新的方法来提升模型适应性和隐私保护。

Method: FedBE通过自适应扩展Transformer块并动态分配可训练块，分离新旧知识，以适应异构联邦环境。

Conclusion: FedBE有效解决了联邦微调中的关键挑战，为分布式数据环境中的模型适应提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FedFT) of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as
a promising solution for adapting models to distributed data environments while
ensuring data privacy.
  Existing FedFT methods predominantly utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques to reduce communication and computation overhead.
  However, they often fail to adequately address the catastrophic forgetting, a
critical challenge arising from continual adaptation in distributed
environments. The traditional centralized fine-tuning methods, which are not
designed for the heterogeneous and privacy-constrained nature of federated
environments, struggle to mitigate this issue effectively. Moreover, the
challenge is further exacerbated by significant variation in data distributions
and device capabilities across clients, which leads to intensified forgetting
and degraded model generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose FedBE, a
novel FedFT framework that integrates an adaptive transformer block expansion
mechanism with a dynamic trainable-block allocation strategy. Specifically,
FedBE expands trainable blocks within the model architecture, structurally
separating newly learned task-specific knowledge from the original pre-trained
representations. Additionally, FedBE dynamically assigns these trainable blocks
to clients based on their data distributions and computational capabilities.
This enables the framework to better accommodate heterogeneous federated
environments and enhances the generalization ability of the model.Extensive
experiments show that compared with existing federated fine-tuning methods,
FedBE achieves 12-74% higher accuracy retention on general tasks after
fine-tuning and a model convergence acceleration ratio of 1.9-3.1x without
degrading the accuracy of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Extended reality (XR) systems, which consist of virtual reality (VR),
augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (XR), offer a transformative
interface for immersive, multi-modal, and embodied human-computer interaction.
In this paper, we envision that multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated
foundation models (FedFMs) can offer transformative capabilities for XR systems
through integrating the representational strength of M3T foundation models
(FMs) with the privacy-preserving model training principles of federated
learning (FL). We present a modular architecture for FedFMs, which entails
different coordination paradigms for model training and aggregations. Central
to our vision is the codification of XR challenges that affect the
implementation of FedFMs under the SHIFT dimensions: (1) Sensor and modality
diversity, (2) Hardware heterogeneity and system-level constraints, (3)
Interactivity and embodied personalization, (4) Functional/task variability,
and (5) Temporality and environmental variability. We illustrate the
manifestation of these dimensions across a set of emerging and anticipated
applications of XR systems. Finally, we propose evaluation metrics, dataset
requirements, and design tradeoffs necessary for the development of
resource-aware FedFMs in XR. This perspective aims to chart the technical and
conceptual foundations for context-aware privacy-preserving intelligence in the
next generation of XR systems.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at capturing structural and
semantic information in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), while struggling to
generalize across domains and tasks. Recently, some researchers have turned to
integrating HGNNs with large language models (LLMs) for more generalizable
heterogeneous graph learning. However, these approaches typically extract
structural information via HGNNs as HG tokens, and disparities in embedding
spaces between HGNNs and LLMs have been shown to bias the LLM's comprehension
of HGs. Moreover, as these HG tokens are often derived from node-level tasks,
the model's ability to generalize across tasks remains limited. To this end, we
propose a simple yet effective Masked Language Modeling-based method, called
MLM4HG. MLM4HG introduces metapath-based textual sequences instead of HG tokens
to extract structural and semantic information inherent in HGs, and designs
customized textual templates to unify different graph tasks into a coherent
cloze-style "mask" token prediction paradigm. Specifically, MLM4HG first
converts HGs from various domains to texts based on metapaths, and subsequently
combines them with the unified task texts to form a HG-based corpus. Moreover,
the corpus is fed into a pretrained LM for fine-tuning with a constrained
target vocabulary, enabling the fine-tuned LM to generalize to unseen target
HGs. Extensive cross-domain and multi-task experiments on four real-world

Abstract: Community-level blocklists are key to content moderation practices in
decentralized social media. These blocklists enable moderators to prevent other
communities, such as those acting in bad faith, from interacting with their own
-- and, if shared publicly, warn others about communities worth blocking. Prior
work has examined blocklists in centralized social media, noting their
potential for collective moderation outcomes, but has focused on blocklists as
individual-level tools. To understand how moderators perceive and utilize
community-level blocklists and what additional support they may need, we
examine social media communities running Mastodon, an open-source microblogging
software built on the ActivityPub protocol. We conducted (1) content analysis
of the community-level blocklist ecosystem, and (2) semi-structured interviews
with twelve Mastodon moderators. Our content analysis revealed wide variation
in blocklist goals, inclusion criteria, and transparency. Interviews showed
moderators balance proactive safety, reactive practices, and caution around

*Kieu Dang,Phung Lai,NhatHai Phan,Yelong Shen,Ruoming Jin,Abdallah Khreishah,My Thai*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文聚焦于大语言模型（LLMs）中的水印技术，系统地对其分类、效果及局限性进行分析，并探讨实际挑战与未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的广泛应用带来了知识产权风险，模型窃取攻击尤其严重，因此需要水印技术来保护其安全和伦理部署。

Method: 提出水印分类法、新型知识产权分类器，并在攻击与非攻击环境中评估水印效果，分析现有水印的局限性。

Result: 现有水印技术虽受关注，但对模型实用性和下游任务的负面影响限制了其实际应用潜力。

Conclusion: 需开发更实用的水印解决方案以适配LLMs的部署需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
demonstrating impressive capabilities across diverse tasks. However, deploying
these models introduces critical risks related to intellectual property
violations and potential misuse, particularly as adversaries can imitate these
models to steal services or generate misleading outputs. We specifically focus
on model stealing attacks, as they are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and
pose a serious threat to their security, revenue, and ethical deployment. While
various watermarking techniques have emerged to mitigate these risks, it
remains unclear how far the community and industry have progressed in
developing and deploying watermarks in LLMs.
  To bridge this gap, we aim to develop a comprehensive systematization for
watermarks in LLMs by 1) presenting a detailed taxonomy for watermarks in LLMs,
2) proposing a novel intellectual property classifier to explore the
effectiveness and impacts of watermarks on LLMs under both attack and
attack-free environments, 3) analyzing the limitations of existing watermarks
in LLMs, and 4) discussing practical challenges and potential future directions
for watermarks in LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we show that despite
promising research outcomes and significant attention from leading companies
and community to deploy watermarks, these techniques have yet to reach their
full potential in real-world applications due to their unfavorable impacts on
model utility of LLMs and downstream tasks. Our findings provide an insightful
understanding of watermarks in LLMs, highlighting the need for practical
watermarks solutions tailored to LLM deployment.

*Yuan Xun,Siyuan Liang,Xiaojun Jia,Xinwei Liu,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级、无先验认证的防御框架，用于保护大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）免受隐蔽的后门攻击，仅通过微调解器模块和文本嵌入层来实现高效防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门防御技术无法在模型核心参数不可修改或缺乏攻击先验知识的现实场景中发挥作用，而LVLMs在微调时易受到固定触发器的过拟合影响，导致恶意关联。

Method: 作者提出了Robust Instruction Tuning框架，通过输入多样性正则化和异常激活正则化两种机制，破坏触发器的一致性并稀疏化异常激活权重，从而学习语义表征而非触发器响应映射。

Result: 在Flickr30k和MSCOCO数据集上的实验表明，该方法能将七种攻击的成功率降至接近零，且训练成本仅增加不到15%。

Conclusion: 该研究为LVLMs的后门防御提供了一种高效且无需核心参数修改的解决方案，显著提升了模型的安全性。

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated excellent
instruction-following capabilities, yet remain vulnerable to stealthy backdoor
attacks when finetuned using contaminated data. Existing backdoor defense
techniques are usually developed for single-modal visual or language models
under fully parameter-adjustable settings or rely on supervisory knowledge
during training. However, in real-world scenarios, defenders cannot modify
frozen visual encoders or core LLM parameters, nor possess prior knowledge of
unknown trigger patterns or target responses. Motivated by the empirical
finding that LVLMs readily overfit to fixed, unknown triggers, which can embed
malicious associations during adapter-level tuning, we aim to design a defense
that operates without access to core weights or attack priors. To this end, we
introduce a lightweight, certified-agnostic defense framework, Robust
Instruction Tuning, that finetunes only adapter modules and text embedding
layers under instruction tuning. Our method integrates two complementary
regularizations: (1) Input Diversity Regularization, which perturbs trigger
components across training samples to disrupt consistent spurious cues; and (2)
Anomalous Activation Regularization, which dynamically sparses adapter weights
exhibiting abnormally sharp activations linked to backdoor patterns. These
mechanisms jointly guide the model toward learning semantically grounded
representations rather than memorizing superficial trigger-response mappings.
  Extensive experiments against seven attacks on Flickr30k and MSCOCO
demonstrate that ours
  reduces their attack success rate to nearly zero, with an increase in
training cost of less than 15%.

Motivation: 解决资源受限移动设备在联邦学习中因图像质量异构导致的准确性下降问题。

Method: 为不同图像质量级别训练本地模型，通过质量加权融合机制聚合特征，并结合差分隐私保护。

Result: 在MNIST上实现92.31%准确率，隐私约束下保持30.77%准确率，低端设备贡献最高（63.5%）。

Conclusion: QA-HFL通过设备特定正则化、自适应加权和知识蒸馏，有效提升性能并保持高效通信。

Abstract: This paper introduces QA-HFL, a quality-aware hierarchical federated learning
framework that efficiently handles heterogeneous image quality across
resource-constrained mobile devices. Our approach trains specialized local
models for different image quality levels and aggregates their features using a
quality-weighted fusion mechanism, while incorporating differential privacy
protection. Experiments on MNIST demonstrate that QA-HFL achieves 92.31%
accuracy after just three federation rounds, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods like FedRolex (86.42%). Under strict privacy
constraints, our approach maintains 30.77% accuracy with formal differential
privacy guarantees. Counter-intuitively, low-end devices contributed most
significantly (63.5%) to the final model despite using 100 fewer parameters
than high-end counterparts. Our quality-aware approach addresses accuracy
decline through device-specific regularization, adaptive weighting, intelligent
client selection, and server-side knowledge distillation, while maintaining
efficient communication with a 4.71% compression ratio. Statistical analysis
confirms that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods (p 0.01)
under both standard and privacy-constrained conditions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了基于Nexagon协议的增强安全架构，通过PKI和临时假名证书解决用户重识别和稀疏区域攻击问题，并验证了其可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Nexagon协议在安全和隐私方面的漏洞，如用户重识别和会话链接问题。

Method: 应用STRIDE和LINDDUN威胁建模框架，提出结合PKI和临时假名证书的安全架构。

Result: 原型验证显示，安全性和隐私性提升，且延迟增加不超过25%，吞吐量降低不超过7%。

Conclusion: 提出的架构能有效保护隐私和安全性，适合实际部署。

Abstract: A critical requirement for modern-day Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS) is the ability to collect geo-referenced data from connected vehicles and
mobile devices in a safe, secure and anonymous way. The Nexagon protocol, which
builds on the IETF Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) and the Hierarchical
Hexagonal Clustering (H3) geo-spatial indexing system, offers a promising
framework for dynamic, privacy-preserving data aggregation. Seeking to address
the critical security and privacy vulnerabilities that persist in its current
specification, we apply the STRIDE and LINDDUN threat modelling frameworks and
prove among other that the Nexagon protocol is susceptible to user
re-identification, session linkage, and sparse-region attacks. To address these
challenges, we propose an enhanced security architecture that combines public
key infrastructure (PKI) with ephemeral pseudonym certificates. Our solution
guarantees user and device anonymity through randomized key rotation and
adaptive geospatial resolution, thereby effectively mitigating
re-identification and surveillance risks in sparse environments. A prototype
implementation over a microservice-based overlay network validates the approach
and underscores its readiness for real-world deployment. Our results show that
it is possible to achieve the required level of security without increasing
latency by more than 25% or reducing the throughput by more than 7%.

TL;DR: DPClustX框架在满足差分隐私的条件下为聚类结果提供解释，解决了隐私保护与数据分析之间的矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在差分隐私(DP)下解释聚类结果具有挑战性，现有框架可能泄露敏感信息。

Method: 提出DPClustX框架，输入敏感数据和私有聚类标签，输出满足DP的全局解释。

Result: 实验表明，即使在严格隐私约束下，DPClustX仍能提供准确且富有洞察力的解释。

Conclusion: DPClustX成功平衡了隐私保护与聚类解释的需求，为数据分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: The dire need to protect sensitive data has led to various flavors of privacy
definitions. Among these, Differential privacy (DP) is considered one of the
most rigorous and secure notions of privacy, enabling data analysis while
preserving the privacy of data contributors. One of the fundamental tasks of
data analysis is clustering , which is meant to unravel hidden patterns within
complex datasets. However, interpreting clustering results poses significant
challenges, and often necessitates an extensive analytical process.
Interpreting clustering results under DP is even more challenging, as analysts
are provided with noisy responses to queries, and longer, manual exploration
sessions require additional noise to meet privacy constraints. While increasing
attention has been given to clustering explanation frameworks that aim at
assisting analysts by automatically uncovering the characteristics of each
cluster, such frameworks may also disclose sensitive information within the
dataset, leading to a breach in privacy. To address these challenges, we
present DPClustX, a framework that provides explanations for black-box
clustering results while satisfying DP. DPClustX takes as input the sensitive
dataset alongside privately computed clustering labels, and outputs a global
explanation, emphasizing prominent characteristics of each cluster while
guaranteeing DP. We perform an extensive experimental analysis of DPClustX on
real data, showing that it provides insightful and accurate explanations even
under tight privacy constraints.

TL;DR: 文章提出了一种名为FedShield-LLM的新方法，通过结合剪枝和全同态加密技术，在联邦学习中保护大型语言模型的隐私，同时优化了跨组织环境下的训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中大型语言模型训练中的隐私问题和计算资源不足的挑战。

Method: 使用剪枝和全同态加密（FHE）对LoRA参数进行处理，结合优化的联邦学习算法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在保护隐私的同时提升了模型性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedShield-LLM为资源受限的组织提供了一种高效且安全的大型语言模型训练解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized framework for training and
fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging computational resources
across organizations while keeping sensitive data on local devices. It
addresses privacy and security concerns while navigating challenges associated
with the substantial computational demands of LLMs, which can be prohibitive
for small and medium-sized organizations. FL supports the development of
task-specific LLMs for cross-silo applications through fine-tuning but remains
vulnerable to inference attacks, such as membership inference and gradient
inversion, which threaten data privacy. Prior studies have utilized
Differential Privacy (DP) in LLM fine-tuning, which, despite being effective at
preserving privacy, can degrade model performance. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a novel method, FedShield-LLM, that uses pruning with
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) parameters,
enabling secure computations on encrypted model updates while mitigating the
attack surface by deactivating less important LoRA parameters. Furthermore,
optimized federated algorithms for cross-silo environments enhance scalability
and efficiency. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA
substantially reduce computational and communication overhead, making FL
feasible for resource-constrained clients. Experimental results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing methods while maintaining robust privacy
protection, enabling organizations to collaboratively train secure and
efficient LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ORCAS，一种基于DESG的抗混淆二进制代码相似性分析模型，显著提升了在混淆条件下的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于图的二进制代码相似性分析方法在代码混淆下表现不佳，主要原因是控制流不稳定。

Method: 开发了ORCAS模型，采用Dominance Enhanced Semantic Graph (DESG)表示二进制代码，捕捉更多隐式语义，避免依赖控制流结构。

Result: ORCAS在多种混淆选项、优化级别和指令集架构下表现优异，平均PR-AUC提升12.1%，并且在真实漏洞数据集上召回率提升高达43%。

Conclusion: ORCAS是一种抗混淆的二进制代码相似性分析方法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Binary code similarity analysis (BCSA) serves as a core technique for binary
analysis tasks such as vulnerability detection. While current graph-based BCSA
approaches capture substantial semantics and show strong performance, their
performance suffers under code obfuscation due to the unstable control flow. To
address this issue, we develop ORCAS, an Obfuscation-Resilient BCSA model based
on Dominance Enhanced Semantic Graph (DESG). The DESG is an original binary
code representation, capturing more binaries' implicit semantics without
control flow structure, including inter-instruction relations, inter-basic
block relations, and instruction-basic block relations. ORCAS robustly scores
semantic similarity across binary functions from different obfuscation options,
optimization levels, and instruction set architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BinKit dataset shows ORCAS significantly outperforms eight baselines,
achieving an average 12.1% PR-AUC gain when using combined three obfuscation
options compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, ORCAS
improves recall by up to 43% on an original obfuscated real-world vulnerability
dataset, which we released to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Precise control of neural activity -- modulating target neurons deep in the
brain while leaving nearby neurons unaffected -- is an outstanding challenge in
neuroscience, generally achieved through invasive techniques. This study
investigates the possibility of precisely and noninvasively modulating neural
activity in the high-level primate ventral visual stream via perturbations on
one's natural visual feed. When tested on macaque inferior temporal (IT) neural
populations, we found quantitative agreement between the model-predicted and
biologically realized effect: strong modulation concentrated on targeted neural
sites. We extended this to demonstrate accurate injection of
experimenter-chosen neural population patterns via subtle perturbations applied
on the background of typical natural visual feeds. These results highlight that
current machine-executable models of the ventral stream can now design
noninvasive, visually-delivered, possibly imperceptible neural interventions at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是了解学生在高等教育中如何与生成AI工具互动和感知，以促进负责任和有效的技术采用。

Method: 采用混合方法，包括前后调查、系统使用日志和对学生向AI聊天机器人提出的开放式问题和提示的定性分析。

Result: 学生对AI助手的便利性和舒适性表示赞赏，但对伦理问题和机构政策的不确定性感到担忧。

Conclusion: 研究表明，学生愿意将AI作为补充工具，但需要清晰的制度和教师指导以确保其有效性和信任度。

Abstract: As generative AI tools become increasingly integrated into higher education,
understanding how students interact with and perceive these technologies is
essential for responsible and effective adoption. This study evaluates the use
of the Educational AI Hub, an AI-powered learning framework, in undergraduate
civil and environmental engineering courses at a large R1 public university.
Using a mixed-methods approach that combines pre- and post-surveys, system
usage logs, and qualitative analysis of the open-ended prompts and questions
students posed to the AI chatbot, the research explores students' perceptions
of trust, ethical concerns, usability, and learning outcomes. Findings reveal
that students appreciated the AI assistant for its convenience and comfort,
with nearly half reporting greater ease in using the AI tool compared to
seeking help from instructors or teaching assistants. The tool was seen as most
helpful for completing homework and understanding course concepts, though
perceptions of its instructional quality were mixed. Ethical concerns emerged
as a key barrier to full engagement: while most students viewed AI use as
ethically acceptable, many expressed uncertainties about institutional policies
and apprehension about potential academic misconduct. This study contributes to
the growing body of research on AI in education by highlighting the importance
of usability, policy clarity, and faculty guidance in fostering meaningful AI
engagement. The findings suggest that while students are ready to embrace AI as
a supplement to human instruction, thoughtful integration and transparent
institutional frameworks are critical for ensuring student confidence, trust,
and learning effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少数族裔在社会中被边缘化，面临更高的在线风险，但相关研究匮乏。本文旨在填补这一空白，探讨他们的隐私与安全体验。

Method: 通过对英国44名少数族裔的半结构化访谈进行主题分析，研究他们在健康、住房和能源领域使用在线服务的体验。

Result: 隐私担忧和数据控制缺失是主要议题，受访者采取选择性披露等策略。对机构的不信任影响了行为，尤其是对种族歧视的恐惧。

Conclusion: 研究强调需设计更包容的在线服务，考虑边缘化群体的隐私需求和不信任问题。

Abstract: Minoritised ethnic people are marginalised in society, and therefore at a
higher risk of adverse online harms, including those arising from the loss of
security and privacy of personal data. Despite this, there has been very little
research focused on minoritised ethnic people's security and privacy concerns,
attitudes, and behaviours. In this work, we provide the results of one of the
first studies in this regard. We explore minoritised ethnic people's
experiences of using essential online services across three sectors: health,
social housing, and energy, their security and privacy-related concerns, and
responses towards these services. We conducted a thematic analysis of 44
semi-structured interviews with people of various reported minoritised
ethnicities in the UK. Privacy concerns and lack of control over personal data
emerged as a major theme, with many interviewees considering privacy as their
most significant concern when using online services. Several creative tactics
to exercise some agency were reported, including selective and inconsistent
disclosure of personal data. A core concern about how data may be used was
driven by a fear of repercussions, including penalisation and discrimination,
influenced by prior experiences of institutional and online racism. The
increased concern and potential for harm resulted in minoritised ethnic people
grappling with a higher-stakes dilemma of whether to disclose personal
information online or not. Furthermore, trust in institutions, or lack thereof,
was found to be embedded throughout as a basis for adapting behaviour. We draw
on our results to provide lessons learned for the design of more inclusive,

*Zackary Okun Dunivin,Paul E. Smaldino*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文讨论了科学推荐系统过度依赖流行度导致的知识同质化问题，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统通过“富者愈富”机制导致少数高知名度论文主导可见性，抑制了科学多样性和创新。

Method: 建议重新设计搜索平台，引入用户自定义权重（如流行度、时效性、相关性），并利用词嵌入和LLM增强用户自主性。

Result: 通过用户自主调整和新技术应用，有望提升推荐系统的多样性和科学性。

Conclusion: 增强用户自主性的平台设计是迈向更稳健、动态信息访问系统的重要一步。

Abstract: Scientific recommender systems, such as Google Scholar and Web of Science,
are essential tools for discovery. Search algorithms that power work through
stigmergy, a collective intelligence mechanism that surfaces useful paths
through repeated engagement. While generally effective, this
``rich-get-richer'' dynamic results in a small number of high-profile papers
that dominate visibility. This essay argues argue that these algorithm
over-reliance on popularity fosters intellectual homogeneity and exacerbates
structural inequities, stifling innovative and diverse perspectives critical
for scientific progress. We propose an overhaul of search platforms to
incorporate user-specific calibration, allowing researchers to manually adjust
the weights of factors like popularity, recency, and relevance. We also advise
platform developers on how word embeddings and LLMs could be implemented in
ways that increase user autonomy. While our suggestions are particularly
pertinent to aligning recommender systems with scientific values, these ideas
are broadly applicable to information access systems in general. Designing
platforms that increase user autonomy is an important step toward more robust
and dynamic information

*Chongshang Yan,Jiaxuan He,Delun Li,Yi Yang,Wenjie Song*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合环境属性地图（EAM）和MLLM分层推理模块（MHR）的主动目标导航框架，显著提升了在未知开放环境中零样本目标导航的成功率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本目标导航（ZSON）在高维度隐式场景信息和长距离目标搜索任务中性能下降的问题。

Method: 采用EAM模块通过SBERT和扩散模型推理观察和预测未观察环境，结合MHR模块进行前沿探索决策，优化路径效率。

Result: 在MP3D数据集上EAM模块实现64.5%的场景映射准确率，导航任务在HM3D和MP3D基准上分别达到28.4%和26.3%的SPL，相对基线方法分别提升21.4%和46.0%。

Conclusion: 所提出的EAM和MHR框架有效提升了零样本目标导航的性能和效率，解决了长距离搜索和高维场景信息的挑战。

Abstract: The zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unknown open-ended environments
coupled with semantically novel target often suffers from the significant
decline in performance due to the neglect of high-dimensional implicit scene
information and the long-range target searching task. To address this, we
proposed an active object navigation framework with Environmental Attributes
Map (EAM) and MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning module (MHR) to improve its success
rate and efficiency. EAM is constructed by reasoning observed environments with
SBERT and predicting unobserved ones with Diffusion, utilizing human space
regularities that underlie object-room correlations and area adjacencies. MHR
is inspired by EAM to perform frontier exploration decision-making, avoiding
the circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to improve path efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the EAM module achieves 64.5\% scene
mapping accuracy on MP3D dataset, while the navigation task attains SPLs of
28.4\% and 26.3\% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks respectively - representing
absolute improvements of 21.4\% and 46.0\% over baseline methods.

Abstract: Manipulation has long been a challenging task for robots, while humans can
effortlessly perform complex interactions with objects, such as hanging a cup
on the mug rack. A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for
teaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot
action in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot
to learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within
diverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find
that understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical
clue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for
both humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow
world model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts
the future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action
planning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical
flow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect
pipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics
from these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on
language instructions. With the generated 3D object optical flow, we propose a
flow-guided rendering mechanism, which renders the predicted final state and
leverages GPT-4o to assess whether the predicted flow aligns with the task
description. This equips the robot with a closed-loop planning ability.
Finally, we consider the predicted 3D optical flow as constraints for an
optimization policy to determine a chunk of robot actions for manipulation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization across diverse robotic
manipulation tasks and reliable cross-embodiment adaptation without
hardware-specific training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统土壤采样和分析方法劳动密集、耗时且空间分辨率有限，不适合大规模精准农业。

Method: 系统由两部分组成：样本采集系统（SAS）和样本分析实验室（Lab），分别用于自动采样和实时分析土壤性质。

Result: 试验表明，SAS能稳定采集50克、深度200毫米的土壤样本，Lab能在10分钟内准确测量pH值和大量营养素。

Conclusion: 系统有望为农民提供及时的数据支持，实现高效可持续的土壤管理和施肥。

Abstract: Traditional soil sampling and analysis methods are labor-intensive,
time-consuming, and limited in spatial resolution, making them unsuitable for
large-scale precision agriculture. To address these limitations, we present a
robotic solution for real-time sampling, analysis and mapping of key soil
properties. Our system consists of two main sub-systems: a Sample Acquisition
System (SAS) for precise, automated in-field soil sampling; and a Sample
Analysis Lab (Lab) for real-time soil property analysis. The system's
performance was validated through extensive field trials at a large-scale
Australian farm. Experimental results show that the SAS can consistently
acquire soil samples with a mass of 50g at a depth of 200mm, while the Lab can
process each sample within 10 minutes to accurately measure pH and
macronutrients. These results demonstrate the potential of the system to
provide farmers with timely, data-driven insights for more efficient and
sustainable soil management and fertilizer application.

TL;DR: PyGemini是一个基于Python的统一框架，旨在解决海上自主开发工具分散的问题，通过配置驱动开发（CDD）提升模块化、可维护性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前海上自主开发工具分散且效率低下，限制了跨学科合作和认证案例的建立，PyGemini旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 引入配置驱动开发（CDD）过程，结合行为驱动开发（BDD）、数据导向设计和容器化，支持灵活的软件架构。

Result: PyGemini提供了多种工具，包括3D内容生成、场景生成和生成人工智能管道，为海上机器人研究提供了可扩展的基础。

Conclusion: PyGemini为未来海上自主研究提供了一个性能优化、可维护性强的统一开发框架。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and certifiability of autonomous surface vessels (ASVs)
requires robust decision-making systems, supported by extensive simulation,
testing, and validation across a broad range of scenarios. However, the current
landscape of maritime autonomy development is fragmented -- relying on
disparate tools for communication, simulation, monitoring, and system
integration -- which hampers interdisciplinary collaboration and inhibits the
creation of compelling assurance cases, demanded by insurers and regulatory
bodies. Furthermore, these disjointed tools often suffer from performance
bottlenecks, vendor lock-in, and limited support for continuous integration
workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce PyGemini, a permissively
licensed, Python-native framework that builds on the legacy of Autoferry Gemini
to unify maritime autonomy development. PyGemini introduces a novel
Configuration-Driven Development (CDD) process that fuses Behavior-Driven
Development (BDD), data-oriented design, and containerization to support
modular, maintainable, and scalable software architectures. The framework
functions as a stand-alone application, cloud-based service, or embedded
library -- ensuring flexibility across research and operational contexts. We
demonstrate its versatility through a suite of maritime tools -- including 3D
content generation for simulation and monitoring, scenario generation for
autonomy validation and training, and generative artificial intelligence
pipelines for augmenting imagery -- thereby offering a scalable, maintainable,
and performance-oriented foundation for future maritime robotics and autonomy
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在提取PICO元素中的Outcomes时存在忽视或过度简化的问题，需要一个更全面、高质量的标注语料库来支持相关研究。

Method: 通过临床医生和NLP专家的迭代讨论制定标注指南，由三名独立标注者标注500篇PubMed摘要和140篇EBM-NLP摘要，构建EvidenceOutcomes库，并使用PubMedBERT模型进行测试。

Result: 标注一致性达0.76，PubMedBERT模型的F1分数在实体级别为0.69，在标记级别为0.76。

Conclusion: EvidenceOutcomes可作为未来机器学习算法开发和测试的共享基准，用于提取生物医学摘要中的临床有意义结果。

Abstract: The fundamental process of evidence extraction and synthesis in
evidence-based medicine involves extracting PICO (Population, Intervention,
Comparison, and Outcome) elements from biomedical literature. However,
Outcomes, being the most complex elements, are often neglected or
oversimplified in existing benchmarks. To address this issue, we present
EvidenceOutcomes, a novel, large, annotated corpus of clinically meaningful
outcomes extracted from biomedical literature. We first developed a robust
annotation guideline for extracting clinically meaningful outcomes from text
through iteration and discussion with clinicians and Natural Language
Processing experts. Then, three independent annotators annotated the Results
and Conclusions sections of a randomly selected sample of 500 PubMed abstracts
and 140 PubMed abstracts from the existing EBM-NLP corpus. This resulted in
EvidenceOutcomes with high-quality annotations of an inter-rater agreement of
0.76. Additionally, our fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, applied to these 500
PubMed abstracts, achieved an F1-score of 0.69 at the entity level and 0.76 at
the token level on the subset of 140 PubMed abstracts from the EBM-NLP corpus.
EvidenceOutcomes can serve as a shared benchmark to develop and test future
machine learning algorithms to extract clinically meaningful outcomes from
biomedical abstracts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然生成式大语言模型在其他NLP任务中表现优异，但在语义角色标注（SRL）任务中仍落后于BERT-like模型，因此研究如何弥补这一差距。

Method: 采用检索增强生成机制（利用外部语言学知识）和自我校正机制（修正不一致的输出）来改进LLMs在SRL中的表现。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的SRL基准测试（CPB1.0、CoNLL-2009和CoNLL-2012）中达到最先进性能，首次在SRL任务中超越编码器-解码器模型。

Conclusion: 通过结合检索增强和自我校正，生成式大语言模型能够在SRL任务中实现更好的性能，填补了与BERT-like模型的差距。

Abstract: Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a crucial task of natural language processing
(NLP). Although generative decoder-based large language models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks, they still lag behind
state-of-the-art encoder-decoder (BERT-like) models in SRL. In this work, we
seek to bridge this gap by equipping LLMs for SRL with two mechanisms: (a)
retrieval-augmented generation and (b) self-correction. The first mechanism
enables LLMs to leverage external linguistic knowledge such as predicate and
argument structure descriptions, while the second allows LLMs to identify and
correct inconsistent SRL outputs. We conduct extensive experiments on three
widely-used benchmarks of SRL (CPB1.0, CoNLL-2009, and CoNLL-2012). Results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
Chinese and English, marking the first successful application of LLMs to
surpass encoder-decoder approaches in SRL.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在有限患者信息下生成长格式临床笔记的不足。

Method: 结合强化学习与知识图谱检索（R2AG），并提出GRO优化检索质量。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV-Note数据集上表现优异，填补语义空白并减少临床误解。

Conclusion: R2AG通过检索推理路径提升临床笔记生成质量，尤其在稀疏输入场景下效果显著。

Abstract: Clinical note generation aims to automatically produce free-text summaries of
a patient's condition and diagnostic process, with discharge instructions being
a representative long-form example. While recent large language model
(LLM)-based methods pre-trained on general clinical corpora show promise in
clinical text generation, they fall short in producing long-form notes from
limited patient information. In this paper, we propose R2AG, the first
reinforced retriever for long-form discharge instruction generation based on
pre-admission data. R2AG is trained with reinforcement learning to retrieve
reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph, providing explicit semantic
guidance to the LLM. To bridge the information gap, we propose Group-Based
Retriever Optimization (GRO) which improves retrieval quality with
group-relative rewards, encouraging reasoning leaps for deeper inference by the
LLM. Comprehensive experiments on the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset show that R2AG
outperforms baselines in both clinical efficacy and natural language generation
metrics. Further analysis reveals that R2AG fills semantic gaps in sparse input
scenarios, and retrieved reasoning paths help LLMs avoid clinical
misinterpretation by focusing on key evidence and following coherent reasoning.

Result: 实验显示ASTS在故事生成和摘要任务中表现优于现有方法，减少了重复并提升了语义对齐和流畅性。

Conclusion: ASTS是一种高效且有效的解码策略，适用于需要高质量文本生成的场景。

Abstract: This chapter explores advancements in decoding strategies for large language
models (LLMs), focusing on enhancing the Locally Typical Sampling (LTS)
algorithm. Traditional decoding methods, such as top-k and nucleus sampling,
often struggle to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation.
To address these challenges, Adaptive Semantic-Aware Typicality Sampling (ASTS)
is proposed as an improved version of LTS, incorporating dynamic entropy
thresholding, multi-objective scoring, and reward-penalty adjustments. ASTS
ensures contextually coherent and diverse text generation while maintaining
computational efficiency. Its performance is evaluated across multiple
benchmarks, including story generation and abstractive summarization, using
metrics such as perplexity, MAUVE, and diversity scores. Experimental results
demonstrate that ASTS outperforms existing sampling techniques by reducing
repetition, enhancing semantic alignment, and improving fluency.

Abstract: Open-access corpora are essential for advancing natural language processing
(NLP) and computational social science (CSS). However, large-scale resources
for German remain limited, restricting research on linguistic trends and
societal issues such as gender bias. We present taz2024full, the largest
publicly available corpus of German newspaper articles to date, comprising over
1.8 million texts from taz, spanning 1980 to 2024.
  As a demonstration of the corpus's utility for bias and discrimination
research, we analyse gender representation across four decades of reporting. We
find a consistent overrepresentation of men, but also a gradual shift toward
more balanced coverage in recent years. Using a scalable, structured analysis
pipeline, we provide a foundation for studying actor mentions, sentiment, and
linguistic framing in German journalistic texts.
  The corpus supports a wide range of applications, from diachronic language
analysis to critical media studies, and is freely available to foster inclusive
and reproducible research in German-language NLP.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了新的性别偏见维度，补充了现有AI危害框架，尤其针对电子商务场景。

Abstract: While gender bias in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively
studied in many domains, uses of LLMs in e-commerce remain largely unexamined
and may reveal novel forms of algorithmic bias and harm. Our work investigates
this space, developing data-driven taxonomic categories of gender bias in the
context of product description generation, which we situate with respect to
existing general purpose harms taxonomies. We illustrate how AI-generated
product descriptions can uniquely surface gender biases in ways that require
specialized detection and mitigation approaches. Further, we quantitatively
analyze issues corresponding to our taxonomic categories in two models used for
this task -- GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM -- demonstrating that these
forms of bias commonly occur in practice. Our results illuminate unique,
under-explored dimensions of gender bias, such as assumptions about clothing
size, stereotypical bias in which features of a product are advertised, and
differences in the use of persuasive language. These insights contribute to our
understanding of three types of AI harms identified by current frameworks:
exclusionary norms, stereotyping, and performance disparities, particularly for
the context of e-commerce.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TGTalker的新型时间图学习框架，旨在填补大型语言模型（LLMs）在动态图（如现实世界演化网络）应用中的研究空白。TGTalker通过对时间图的最近偏见利用，提取结构信息并转化为自然语言，同时利用时间邻居信息进行预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现有文献广泛探讨了LLMs在图推理能力上的应用，但LLMs在处理动态图（尤其是真实世界的演化网络）方面的研究仍相对不足。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 研究人员开发了Temporal Graph Talker（TGTalker），该框架通过提取时间图中的结构信息，将其转化为自然语言供LLMs处理，并利用时间邻居作为预测的额外信息。

Result: 在五个真实世界网络中，TGTalker在链接预测任务上表现优异，与现有的时间图神经网络（TGNN）模型相比具有竞争力，且一致优于TGN和HTGN等流行模型。此外，TGTalker还能为每个预测生成文本解释。

Conclusion: TGTalker不仅填补了LLMs在动态图应用中的研究空白，还通过提供可解释的预测结果，为时间链接预测的可解释性开辟了新方向。代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently driven significant advancements in
Natural Language Processing and various other applications. While a broad range
of literature has explored the graph-reasoning capabilities of LLMs, including
their use of predictors on graphs, the application of LLMs to dynamic graphs --
real world evolving networks -- remains relatively unexplored. Recent work
studies synthetic temporal graphs generated by random graph models, but
applying LLMs to real-world temporal graphs remains an open question. To
address this gap, we introduce Temporal Graph Talker (TGTalker), a novel
temporal graph learning framework designed for LLMs. TGTalker utilizes the
recency bias in temporal graphs to extract relevant structural information,
converted to natural language for LLMs, while leveraging temporal neighbors as
additional information for prediction. TGTalker demonstrates competitive link
prediction capabilities compared to existing Temporal Graph Neural Network
(TGNN) models. Across five real-world networks, TGTalker performs competitively
with state-of-the-art temporal graph methods while consistently outperforming
popular models such as TGN and HTGN. Furthermore, TGTalker generates textual
explanations for each prediction, thus opening up exciting new directions in
explainability and interpretability for temporal link prediction. The code is

Motivation: 自动化医疗福利验证电话呼叫可节省时间并加速患者治疗，但需确保高准确性。现有系统因ASR问题和领域术语而受限，需改进。

Method: 引入两阶段后处理流程，使用多ASR替代方案和伪标注方法，无需人工修正转录文本。结合大型语言模型和特征模型。

Result: 实验显示，修正后的通话转录质量显著提升，提高了Auto Review的效率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了ASR问题和领域术语挑战，实现了高准确性和低人工投入的自动化审核。

Abstract: Automating benefit verification phone calls saves time in healthcare and
helps patients receive treatment faster. It is critical to obtain highly
accurate information in these phone calls, as it can affect a patient's
healthcare journey. Given the noise in phone call transcripts, we have a
two-stage system that involves a post-call review phase for potentially noisy
fields, where human reviewers manually verify the extracted
data$\unicode{x2013}$a labor-intensive task. To automate this stage, we
introduce Auto Review, which significantly reduces manual effort while
maintaining a high bar for accuracy. This system, being highly reliant on call
transcripts, suffers a performance bottleneck due to automatic speech
recognition (ASR) issues. This problem is further exacerbated by the use of
domain-specific jargon in the calls. In this work, we propose a second-stage
postprocessing pipeline for accurate information extraction. We improve
accuracy by using multiple ASR alternatives and a pseudo-labeling approach that
does not require manually corrected transcripts. Experiments with
general-purpose large language models and feature-based model pipelines
demonstrate substantial improvements in the quality of corrected call
transcripts, thereby enhancing the efficiency of Auto Review.

### [137] [Homogeneous Keys, Heterogeneous Values: Exploiting Local KV Cache Asymmetry for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05410)
*Wanyun Cui,Mingwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AsymKV的无训练压缩框架，通过利用KV缓存中的不对称性（键的局部同质性和值的异质性分布），显著提升了长上下文模型的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统注意力机制的二次复杂度限制了长上下文建模的效率，而现有KV缓存压缩方法未考虑键和值之间的不对称性，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出AsymKV框架，结合基于同质性的键合并和数学上可证明无损的值压缩技术。

Result: 实验表明，AsymKV在各种任务和基础模型上均优于现有方法，例如在LLaMA3.1-8B上，LongBench平均得分达到43.95，显著优于H$_2$O（38.89）。

Conclusion: AsymKV通过有效利用KV缓存的不对称性，为长上下文建模提供了一种高效且无需训练的压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the critical
importance of extending context length, yet the quadratic complexity of
attention mechanisms poses significant challenges for efficient long-context
modeling. KV cache compression has emerged as a key approach to address this
challenge. Through extensive empirical analysis, we reveal a fundamental yet
previously overlooked asymmetry in KV caches: while adjacent keys receive
similar attention weights (local homogeneity), adjacent values demonstrate
distinct heterogeneous distributions. This key-value asymmetry reveals a
critical limitation in existing compression methods that treat keys and values
uniformly. To address the limitation, we propose a training-free compression
framework (AsymKV) that combines homogeneity-based key merging with a
mathematically proven lossless value compression. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AsymKV consistently outperforms existing long-context methods
across various tasks and base models. For example, on LLaMA3.1-8B, AsymKV
achieves an average score of 43.95 on LongBench, surpassing SOTA methods like
H$_2$O (38.89) by a large margin.

Motivation: 为了解决大型语言模型在 4 位量化中面临的激活异常值问题，SmoothRot 提出了一种高效的后训练量化方法。

Method: SmoothRot 使用通道级缩放和 Hadamard 变换将极端异常值转换为适合量化的激活值。

Result: 实验表明，SmoothRot 在 LLaMA2 7B、LLaMA3.1 8B 和 Mistral 7B 等模型上，将量化模型与 FP16 模型的性能差距缩小了 10-30%，且不增加推理延迟。

Conclusion: SmoothRot 是一种高效的量化技术，显著提升了 LLM 的量化性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We present SmoothRot, a novel post-training quantization technique to enhance
the efficiency of 4-bit quantization in Large Language Models (LLMs). SmoothRot
addresses the critical challenge of massive activation outliers, by integrating
channel-wise scaling with Hadamard transformations. Our technique effectively
transforms extreme outliers into quantization-friendly activations,
significantly improving quantization accuracy. Experiments conducted on popular
LLMs (LLaMA2 7B, LLaMA3.1 8B, and Mistral 7B) demonstrate that SmoothRot
consistently reduces the performance gap between quantized and FP16 models by
approximately 10-30\% across language generation and zero-shot reasoning tasks,
without introducing additional inference latency. Code is available at

Motivation: 探索如何通过计算模型预测Reddit用户对Wordle游戏的趣味反应，从而量化游戏中的幽默创意。

Method: 从Reddit抓取约8万条用户反应，使用GPT-3.5进行少样本分类，提取游戏特征并进行预测分析。

Result: 研究发现，游戏特征能够微弱但显著地预测用户的有趣反应，表明游戏中幽默创意的可测量性。

Conclusion: 用户对Wordle游戏的趣味反应可被计算预测，揭示了游戏幽默创意的量化潜力。

Abstract: We explore automatically predicting which Wordle games Reddit users find
amusing.
  We scrape approximately 80k reactions by Reddit users to Wordle games from
Reddit, classify the reactions as expressing amusement or not using OpenAI's
GPT-3.5 using few-shot prompting, and verify that GPT-3.5's labels roughly
correspond to human labels.
  We then extract features from Wordle games that can predict user amusement.
We demonstrate that the features indeed provide a (weak) signal that predicts
user amusement as predicted by GPT-3.5.
  Our results indicate that user amusement at Wordle games can be predicted
computationally to some extent. We explore which features of the game
contribute to user amusement.
  We find that user amusement is predictable, indicating a measurable aspect of
creativity infused into Wordle games through humor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在动态现实场景中难以持续整合新知识和技能，现有持续学习方法存在局限。

Method: 引入参数隔离和基于MLLM的路由机制，防止灾难性干扰。

Result: 实验表明该方法能高效整合领域知识和功能能力，遗忘最小，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MLLM-CL基准和方法为动态场景持续学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language
understanding but face challenges in adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios
that require continuous integration of new knowledge and skills. While
continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and
methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL,
a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the
former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation
across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID
scenarios with emerging model ability. Methodologically, we propose preventing
catastrophic interference through parameter isolation, along with an MLLM-based
routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can
integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal
forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods.

*Niruthiha Selvanayagam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过无监督机器学习分析特定语言障碍（SLI）儿童的自然语言发展轨迹，发现SLI主要表现为语言产出能力降低而非句法复杂性缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SLI诊断方法可能忽视细微发展模式，研究旨在通过机器学习提供早期识别和干预的新视角。

Method: 分析1163名4-16岁儿童的语言样本，使用主成分分析和聚类评估64种语言特征。

Result: 发现两个主要集群：高语言产出与低SLI发生率组，及低产出但高句法复杂性与高SLI发生率组。

Conclusion: 结果支持语言能力的连续模型，挑战传统分类诊断框架，并突出无监督学习在优化诊断和干预中的潜力。

Abstract: Specific Language Impairment (SLI) affects approximately 7 percent of
children, presenting as isolated language deficits despite normal cognitive
abilities, sensory systems, and supportive environments. Traditional diagnostic
approaches often rely on standardized assessments, which may overlook subtle
developmental patterns. This study aims to identify natural language
development trajectories in children with and without SLI using unsupervised
machine learning techniques, providing insights for early identification and
targeted interventions. Narrative samples from 1,163 children aged 4-16 years
across three corpora (Conti-Ramsden 4, ENNI, and Gillam) were analyzed using
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering. A total of 64 linguistic
features were evaluated to uncover developmental trajectories and distinguish
linguistic profiles. Two primary clusters emerged: (1) high language production
with low SLI prevalence, and (2) limited production but higher syntactic
complexity with higher SLI prevalence. Additionally, boundary cases exhibited
intermediate traits, supporting a continuum model of language abilities.
Findings suggest SLI manifests primarily through reduced production capacity
rather than syntactic complexity deficits. The results challenge categorical
diagnostic frameworks and highlight the potential of unsupervised learning
techniques for refining diagnostic criteria and intervention strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于增强关联规则的方法，通过规则转文本技术增强LLM在数据集问答中的表现，显著优于ChatGPT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何通过可解释的机器学习方法（如增强关联规则）改进LLM对数据集问题的回答，同时兼顾安全性（如结合RAG技术）。

Method: 通过定义知识模式生成规则集，将规则转为文本形式，并作为RAG输入LLM。

Result: 相比ChatGPT（包括使用代理），该方法在数据集问答中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力进一步优化，如引入更多模式或结合规则挖掘代理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are achieving significant progress almost every
moment now. Many advanced techniques have been introduced and widely accepted,
like retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG), agents, and tools. Tools can
query the database to answer questions from structured data files or perform
groupings or other statistics. This unlocks huge opportunities, such as it can
answer any question, but also poses threats, such as safety, because there is
no control over the commands that are created. We would like to discuss whether
we can create a new method that improves answers based on dataset/database via
some interpretable ML methods, namely enhanced association rules. The advantage
would be if the method can be also used in some safe technique like RAG.
Association rules have a sound history. Since the introduction of CN2 and
aproiri, many enhancements have been made. In parallel, enhanced association
rules have been introduced and evolved over the last 40 years. The general
problem is typically that there are too many rules. There are some techniques
for handling it, but when LLM emerged, it turned out to be the best use case
for the RAG technique for LLMs. We proposed a method that generates a ruleset
based on defined knowledge patterns, then converts rules into text form via a
rule-to-text converter, and includes the result as an RAG into LLM. We compared
this method with ChatGPT (even with using agents) and we have discovered a
significant improvement in answering questions based on the dataset. We have
also tried several strategies how much rules to generate. We found this
improvement interesting. Moreover, it can also be improved in many ways as
future work, like incorporating other patterns, the use of rule mining as an
agent, and many others.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决利用电子健康记录（EHR）回答临床问题时如何高效筛选和生成答案的挑战。

Method: 使用大语言模型分两步：1）筛选相关句子，2）生成短答案。采用few-shot提示、自一致性和阈值提升句子分类效果。

Result: 较小的8B模型比70B模型在筛选相关句子时表现更好，准确的句子选择对生成高质量答案至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过自一致性和阈值技术可以提升句子筛选的可靠性，较小模型在此任务中更具优势。

Abstract: We describe our system for the ArchEHR-QA Shared Task on answering clinical
questions using electronic health records (EHRs). Our approach uses large
language models in two steps: first, to find sentences in the EHR relevant to a
clinician's question, and second, to generate a short, citation-supported
response based on those sentences. We use few-shot prompting, self-consistency,
and thresholding to improve the sentence classification step to decide which
sentences are essential. We compare several models and find that a smaller 8B
model performs better than a larger 70B model for identifying relevant
information. Our results show that accurate sentence selection is critical for
generating high-quality responses and that self-consistency with thresholding
helps make these decisions more reliable.

TL;DR: SynthesizeMe是一种通过用户交互生成合成用户角色的方法，用于个性化奖励建模，显著提升了个性化LLM评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的个性化奖励模型大多依赖额外的身份信息，如人口统计细节或预定义的偏好类别，限制了模型的适应性。

Method: SynthesizeMe通过生成和验证解释用户偏好的推理，诱导合成用户角色，并筛选有信息量的历史交互来构建个性化提示。

Result: 使用SynthesizeMe构建的提示将个性化LLM评估准确性提升了4.4%，且在PersonalRewardBench上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: SynthesizeMe提供了一种不依赖额外身份信息的个性化奖励建模方法，显著提升了模型在用户偏好适应上的表现。

Abstract: Recent calls for pluralistic alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs)
encourage adapting models to diverse user preferences. However, most prior work
on personalized reward models heavily rely on additional identity information,
such as demographic details or a predefined set of preference categories. To
this end, we introduce SynthesizeMe, an approach to inducing synthetic user
personas from user interactions for personalized reward modeling. SynthesizeMe
first generates and verifies reasoning to explain user preferences, then
induces synthetic user personas from that reasoning, and finally filters to
informative prior user interactions in order to build personalized prompts for
a particular user. We show that using SynthesizeMe induced prompts improves
personalized LLM-as-a-judge accuracy by 4.4% on Chatbot Arena. Combining
SynthesizeMe derived prompts with a reward model achieves top performance on
PersonalRewardBench: a new curation of user-stratified interactions with
chatbots collected from 854 users of Chatbot Arena and PRISM.

Motivation: 研究LLM是否能准确模拟特定用户的网页行为，但因缺乏高质量、公开的数据集而难以评估其真实性。

Method: 通过在线问卷和自定义浏览器插件收集用户的行为数据（OPERA数据集），包含用户角色、浏览器观察、细粒度行为和即时推理。

Result: 建立了首个评估LLM预测用户行为和推理能力的基准数据集。

Conclusion: OPERA数据集为未来研究LLM作为个性化数字替身奠定了基础。

Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) accurately simulate the next web action of a
specific user? While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating
``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user
behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality,
publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the
internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce
OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected
from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the
first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser
observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time
rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser
plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the
first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's
next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action,
rationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into
LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.

Motivation: 探索阿尔茨海默病筛查中语言异常检测模型的性别干扰问题，填补了此前研究中对说话者性别影响的空白。

Method: 提出了两种方法：Extended Confounding Filter和Dual Filter，用于隔离和消除与性别相关的权重。

Result: transformer模型容易对训练数据分布过拟合，解耦性别权重后模型性能略有下降，但减少了性别干扰。

Conclusion: 解耦性别权重可以有效减少模型对性别的依赖，但需在检测性能和减少干扰之间权衡。

Abstract: Deep transformer models have been used to detect linguistic anomalies in
patient transcripts for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) screening. While
pre-trained neural language models (LMs) fine-tuned on AD transcripts perform
well, little research has explored the effects of the gender of the speakers
represented by these transcripts. This work addresses gender confounding in
dementia detection and proposes two methods: the $\textit{Extended Confounding
Filter}$ and the $\textit{Dual Filter}$, which isolate and ablate weights
associated with gender. We evaluate these methods on dementia datasets with
first-person narratives from patients with cognitive impairment and healthy
controls. Our results show transformer models tend to overfit to training data
distributions. Disrupting gender-related weights results in a deconfounded
dementia classifier, with the trade-off of slightly reduced dementia detection
performance.

Abstract: The performance of large language models in domain-specific tasks
necessitates fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and technically
challenging. This paper focuses on parameter-efficient fine-tuning using soft
prompting, a promising approach that adapts pre-trained models to downstream

Soft Prompting technique with a self-Attention Mechanism (ID-SPAM) that
generates soft prompts based on the input tokens and attends different tokens
with varying importance. Our method is simple and efficient, keeping the number
of trainable parameters small. We show the merits of the proposed approach

results indicate that general purpose LLMs cannot consistently detect or decode
extremist language. However, performance can be significantly improved by
domain adaptation and specialised prompting techniques. These results provide

Conclusion: 该数据集为研究语言模型的记忆机制提供了新工具，并展示了合成数据的潜力与局限性。

Abstract: When language models are trained on textual data, they acquire both knowledge
about the structure of language as well as knowledge of facts about the world.
At inference time, their knowledge of facts can be leveraged to solve
interesting problems and perform useful knowledge work for users. It is well
known that language models can verbatim memorize long sequences from their
training data. However, it is much less well understood how language models
memorize facts seen during training. In this work, we propose a new dataset to
specifically empower researchers to study the dual processes of fact
memorization and verbatim sequence memorization. The dataset consists of
synthetically-generated, webtext-like documents about fictional events, as well
as question-answer pairs about the events. We conduct training experiments
showing how synthetic data about fictional events can be effective in teasing
apart different forms of memorization. We also document the challenges in
effectively building realistic, fictional synthetic data.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了CulturalPersonas，一个用于评估LLMs在文化背景下表达个性的大规模基准测试工具，覆盖六个国家3000个情景问题。结果显示能显著降低模型与人类个性分布的距离，并提出更具文化一致性的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在互动应用中的核心地位提升，如何在文化上适当地表达个性变得至关重要。过去研究忽视了文化与个性的相互作用。

Method: 引入CulturalPersonas，首个大规模人工验证基准测试，包含3000个基于情景的问题，评估三种LLMs。

Result: CulturalPersonas显著降低模型与人类个性分布的Wasserstein距离（减少20%），并产生更符合文化的输出。

Conclusion: CulturalPersonas为LLMs在文化背景下表达个性提供了新方向，有助于开发更具社会智能和全球适应性的LLMs。

Abstract: As LLMs become central to interactive applications, ranging from tutoring to
mental health, the ability to express personality in culturally appropriate
ways is increasingly important. While recent works have explored personality
evaluation of LLMs, they largely overlook the interplay between culture and
personality. To address this, we introduce CulturalPersonas, the first
large-scale benchmark with human validation for evaluating LLMs' personality
expression in culturally grounded, behaviorally rich contexts. Our dataset
spans 3,000 scenario-based questions across six diverse countries, designed to
elicit personality through everyday scenarios rooted in local values. We
evaluate three LLMs, using both multiple-choice and open-ended response
formats. Our results show that CulturalPersonas improves alignment with
country-specific human personality distributions (over a 20% reduction in
Wasserstein distance across models and countries) and elicits more expressive,
culturally coherent outputs compared to existing benchmarks. CulturalPersonas
surfaces meaningful modulated trait outputs in response to culturally grounded
prompts, offering new directions for aligning LLMs to global norms of behavior.
By bridging personality expression and cultural nuance, we envision that
CulturalPersonas will pave the way for more socially intelligent and globally
adaptive LLMs.

supervised methodologies, suffering from dependence on large-scale annotated
data. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) enable zero-shot ECI, they are
prone to causal hallucination-erroneously establishing spurious causal links.
To address these challenges, we propose MEFA, a novel zero-shot framework based
on Multi-source Evidence Fuzzy Aggregation. First, we decompose causality
reasoning into three main tasks (temporality determination, necessity analysis,
and sufficiency verification) complemented by three auxiliary tasks. Second,
leveraging meticulously designed prompts, we guide LLMs to generate uncertain
responses and deterministic outputs. Finally, we quantify LLM's responses of
sub-tasks and employ fuzzy aggregation to integrate these evidence for
causality scoring and causality determination. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks demonstrate that MEFA outperforms second-best unsupervised baselines
by 6.2% in F1-score and 9.3% in precision, while significantly reducing
hallucination-induced errors. In-depth analysis verify the effectiveness of
task decomposition and the superiority of fuzzy aggregation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种统一的语法结构表示方法，结合了短语结构语法（PSG）、依存语法（DG）和范畴语法（CG），并通过对应原则实现了这一目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决不同语法形式主义（PSG、DG、CG）在句法和计算复杂性方面的分散问题，实现统一的表示和分析。

Method: 提出对应原则，并以土耳其语中的非连续从句为例，展示了统一表示的实现步骤。

Result: 统一表示方法不仅整合了PSG、DG和CG的基本原则，还在句法分析和计算复杂性方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 统一的语法结构表示方法为自然语言的非连续性和计算复杂性提供了新的理论视角和实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper advances a unified representation of linguistic structure for
three grammar formalisms, namely, Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG), Dependency
Grammar (DG) and Categorial Grammar (CG) from the perspective of syntactic and
computational complexity considerations. The correspondence principle is
proposed to enable a unified representation of the representational principles
from PSG, DG, and CG. To that end, the paper first illustrates a series of
steps in achieving a unified representation for a discontinuous subordinate
clause from Turkish as an illustrative case. This affords a new way of
approaching discontinuity in natural language from a theoretical point of view
that unites and integrates the basic tenets of PSG, DG, and CG, with
significant consequences for syntactic analysis. Then this paper demonstrates
that a unified representation can simplify computational complexity with
regards to the neurocognitive representation and processing of both continuous
and discontinuous sentences vis-\`a-vis the basic principles of PSG, DG, and
CG.

Result: 研究发现GraphRAG在某些场景下优于传统RAG，并分析了其成功的原因。

Conclusion: GraphRAG-Bench为社区提供了工具，帮助理解图结构在RAG系统中的实际效果，并指导其应用。

Abstract: Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. It
leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts,
enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate
reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG
frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a
critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do
graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this,
we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual
reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of
increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual
summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the
entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final
generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we systematically investigate the
conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG and the underlying reasons
for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application. All related
resources and analyses are collected for the community at

*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于渐进过载原则的课程学习框架（POCL），用于改进语言模型的知识蒸馏（KD），通过从易到难的样本训练和逐步增加的损失函数温度，提升蒸馏模型的稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KD方法在训练过程中可能导致学生模型分布显著变化，引发灾难性遗忘、模式崩溃等问题，需要一种更稳定的方法。

Method: POCL框架包含难度测量器和训练调度器，前者对样本从易到难排序并分区，后者逐步引入样本并应用温度逐渐升高的损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，POCL显著提升了蒸馏学生模型的性能，适用于多种KD方法和模型家族。

Conclusion: 研究证明了排序训练样本在KD中的有效性，提出了结构化训练数据以增强蒸馏模型表现和稳定性的方法。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Rel-LLM的新架构，利用图神经网络（GNN）编码器生成结构化关系提示，解决了传统文本序列化方法在关系深度学习（RDL）中忽视关系结构的问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLMs）在关系深度学习中的应用因文本序列化方法而受限，忽视了关键的关系结构并引入冗余，导致效率低下。

Method: 采用GNN编码器提取实体周围的局部子图，生成包含关系和时间依赖的特征表示，再通过反规范化过程转为结构化提示，结合检索增强生成（RAG）框架让LLM推理关系结构。

Result: Rel-LLM在关键RDL任务中优于现有方法，提供了一种可扩展且高效的大语言模型与结构化数据源结合的方案。

Conclusion: Rel-LLM通过保留数据库的关系结构，显著提升了LLM处理复杂实体关系的能力，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet their application to relational deep learning (RDL)
remains underexplored. Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational
links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into
flat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical
relational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM
context lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a
graph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational
prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework.
Unlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves
the inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to
effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically,
the GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature
representations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal
dependencies. These representations are transformed into structured prompts
using a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over
relational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, offering a scalable and
efficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources. Code is
available at https://github.com/smiles724/Rel-LLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注显式事实的删除，忽略了潜在推理依赖和知识的非确定性特点，导致遗忘效果评估不准确。

Method: 采用知识图表示事实上下文，设计LLM法官进行推理评估，并校准其与人类评估的一致性。

Result: 实验表明该框架提供了更真实严格的遗忘评估，现有方法往往高估了遗忘效果。

Conclusion: 新框架能更准确地评估知识遗忘，揭示了当前方法的不足。

Abstract: Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in
large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus
on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential
dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs.
Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through
correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge
unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit
structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as
knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an
inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these
judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning
success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated
against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability.
Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our
framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning
performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies
tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/Graph-COM/Knowledge_Unlearning.git.

Conclusion: 通过结合结构化数据和自适应提示，该方法有效解决了时序表格问答中的关键挑战，为LLMs提供了更强大的推理能力。

Abstract: Temporal tabular question answering presents a significant challenge for
Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring robust reasoning over structured data,
which is a task where traditional prompting methods often fall short. These
methods face challenges such as memorization, sensitivity to table size, and
reduced performance on complex queries. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce TempTabQA-C, a synthetic dataset designed for systematic and
controlled evaluations, alongside a symbolic intermediate representation that
transforms tables into database schemas. This structured approach allows LLMs
to generate and execute SQL queries, enhancing generalization and mitigating
biases. By incorporating adaptive few-shot prompting with contextually tailored
examples, our method achieves superior robustness, scalability, and
performance. Experimental results consistently highlight improvements across
key challenges, setting a new benchmark for robust temporal reasoning with
LLMs.

Result: 在7B规模模型上显著提升了长文本生成性能，并展现出对长输入推理任务的良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: RL框架为长文本生成提供了新思路，并可能对长上下文训练有启示意义。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled strong
performance in long-form writing, yet existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
approaches suffer from limitations such as data saturation and restricted
learning capacity bounded by teacher signals. In this work, we present
Writing-RL: an Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework to advance
long-form writing capabilities beyond SFT. The framework consists of three key
components: Margin-aware Data Selection strategy that prioritizes samples with
high learning potential, Pairwise Comparison Reward mechanism that provides
discriminative learning signals in the absence of verifiable rewards, and
Dynamic Reference Scheduling approach, which plays a particularly critical role
by adaptively adjusting task difficulty based on evolving model performance.
Experiments on 7B-scale writer models show that our RL framework largely
improves long-form writing performance over strong SFT baselines. Furthermore,
we observe that models trained with long-output RL generalize surprisingly well
to long-input reasoning tasks, potentially offering a promising perspective for
rethinking long-context training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG-based LLM主要针对单模态（文本）检索，无法处理多模态领域特定信息（如知识图谱、临床笔记和分子结构），尤其在医疗领域。

Method: 构建BioMol-MQA数据集，包含多模态KG（文本+分子结构）和设计用于测试LLM在多模态KG上检索与推理能力的复杂问题。

Conclusion: 多模态信息检索与推理对LLM在复杂领域（如医疗）的应用至关重要，BioMol-MQA为相关研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has shown great power in improving Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing RAG-based LLMs are dedicated to
retrieving single modality information, mainly text; while for many real-world
problems, such as healthcare, information relevant to queries can manifest in
various modalities such as knowledge graph, text (clinical notes), and complex
molecular structure. Thus, being able to retrieve relevant multi-modality
domain-specific information, and reason and synthesize diverse knowledge to
generate an accurate response is important. To address the gap, we present
BioMol-MQA, a new question-answering (QA) dataset on polypharmacy, which is
composed of two parts (i) a multimodal knowledge graph (KG) with text and
molecular structure for information retrieval; and (ii) challenging questions
that designed to test LLM capabilities in retrieving and reasoning over
multimodal KG to answer questions. Our benchmarks indicate that existing LLMs
struggle to answer these questions and do well only when given the necessary
background data, signaling the necessity for strong RAG frameworks.

Motivation: 探索LLMs是否能感知时间流逝并据此调整决策行为。

Method: 通过三项实验：令牌时间假说验证、问题回答任务中的响应长度适应、动态环境中的时间压力测试。

Result: LLMs具备一定时间感知能力，能将离散令牌与连续物理时间关联，但能力因模型规模和推理能力而异。

Conclusion: 为LLMs在时间敏感应用中增强时间感知能力提供了理论基础。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at temporal reasoning tasks like
event ordering and duration estimation, their ability to perceive the actual
passage of time remains unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs perceive the
passage of time and adapt their decision-making accordingly through three
complementary experiments. First, we introduce the Token-Time Hypothesis,
positing that LLMs can map discrete token counts to continuous wall-clock time,
and validate this through a dialogue duration judgment task. Second, we
demonstrate that LLMs could use this awareness to adapt their response length
while maintaining accuracy when users express urgency in question answering
tasks. Finally, we develop BombRush, an interactive navigation challenge that
examines how LLMs modify behavior under progressive time pressure in dynamic
environments. Our findings indicate that LLMs possess certain awareness of time
passage, enabling them to bridge discrete linguistic tokens and continuous
physical time, though this capability varies with model size and reasoning
abilities. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for enhancing
temporal awareness in LLMs for time-sensitive applications.

feedback-driven loop. MAPLE integrates 4 key components: (1) a Solver using the
ReAct paradigm for reasoning, (2) a Checker for answer verification, (3) a
Reflector for error diagnosis and strategy correction, and (4) an Archiver
managing long-term memory for experience reuse and evolution. Experiments on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试在金融数值推理任务中不够全面和可信，因此需要一个新的基准来更准确地评估和改进大型推理模型的性能。

Method: 通过更新和标注现有数据集中的问题，并提供详细的Python解决方案和评估标准，构建了涵盖67.8%金融概念的3,133个Python格式化函数，并设计了238个高难度问题。

Result: 测试显示，最佳模型（OpenAI o1）在Hard问题上达到89.1%准确率，但数值精度仍是挑战。结合推理器和编程模型可显著提升性能（例如DeepSeek-R1从83.2%提升至87.8%）。

Conclusion: FinanceReasoning为未来评估和改进大型推理模型在特定领域复杂推理任务中的性能提供了重要基础。

Abstract: We introduce FinanceReasoning, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) in financial numerical
reasoning problems. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key advancements. (1) Credibility: We update 15.6% of the questions from four
public datasets, annotating 908 new questions with detailed Python solutions
and rigorously refining evaluation standards. This enables an accurate
assessment of the reasoning improvements of LRMs. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinanceReasoning covers 67.8% of financial concepts and formulas, significantly
surpassing existing datasets. Additionally, we construct 3,133 Python-formatted
functions, which enhances LRMs' financial reasoning capabilities through
refined knowledge (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 91.6% for GPT-4o). (3) Challenge:
Models are required to apply multiple financial formulas for precise numerical
reasoning on 238 Hard problems. The best-performing model (i.e., OpenAI o1 with
PoT) achieves 89.1% accuracy, yet LRMs still face challenges in numerical
precision. We demonstrate that combining Reasoner and Programmer models can
effectively enhance LRMs' performance (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 87.8% for
DeepSeek-R1). Our work paves the way for future research on evaluating and
improving LRMs in domain-specific complex reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多语言大型推理模型（LRMs）在多语言推理中的机制，特别是在不同语言中的表现差异及其成因。

Method: 使用GRPO在三种语言（中文、韩语、乌克兰语）的翻译数据集上微调模型，监测任务准确性和语言一致性。

Result: GRPO加剧预训练语言失衡，语言一致性奖励可缓解失衡但导致准确率下降，且失衡现象难以逆转。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多语言推理中不同语言的不平等现象，强调了奖励塑造、数据难度和预训练先验在多语言推理中的重要作用。

Abstract: We identify \textbf{Cross-lingual Collapse}, a systematic drift in which the
chain-of-thought (CoT) of a multilingual language model reverts to its dominant
pre-training language even when the prompt is expressed in a different
language. Recent large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved strong logical reasoning performances by
exposing their intermediate reasoning traces, giving rise to large reasoning
models (LRMs). However, the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in LRMs is
not yet fully explored. To investigate the issue, we fine-tune multilingual
LRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of
the GSM$8$K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in three different languages: Chinese,
Korean, and Ukrainian. During training, we monitor both task accuracy and
language consistency of the reasoning chains. Our experiments reveal three key
findings: (i) GRPO rapidly amplifies pre-training language imbalances, leading
to the erosion of low-resource languages within just a few hundred updates;
(ii) language consistency reward mitigates this drift but does so at the
expense of an almost 5 - 10 pp drop in accuracy. and (iii) the resulting
language collapse is severely damaging and largely irreversible, as subsequent
fine-tuning struggles to steer the model back toward its original
target-language reasoning capabilities. Together, these findings point to a
remarkable conclusion: \textit{not all languages are trained equally for
reasoning}. Furthermore, our paper sheds light on the roles of reward shaping,
data difficulty, and pre-training priors in eliciting multilingual reasoning.

Conclusion: 该框架为更经济高效的LLM推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning has proven essential for enhancing the problem-solving
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into
intermediate steps, either explicitly or implicitly. Extending the reasoning
chain at test time through deeper thought processes or broader exploration, can
furthur improve performance, but often incurs substantial costs due to the
explosion in token usage. Yet, many reasoning steps are relatively simple and
can be handled by more efficient smaller-scale language models (SLMs). This
motivates hybrid approaches that allocate subtasks across models of varying
capacities. However, realizing such collaboration requires accurate task
decomposition and difficulty-aware subtask allocation, which is challenging. To
address this, we propose R2-Reasoner, a novel framework that enables
collaborative reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs by dynamically routing
sub-tasks based on estimated complexity. At the core of our framework is a
Reinforced Model Router, composed of a task decomposer and a subtask allocator.
The task decomposer segments complex input queries into logically ordered
subtasks, while the subtask allocator assigns each subtask to the most
appropriate model, ranging from lightweight SLMs to powerful LLMs, balancing
accuracy and efficiency. To train this router, we introduce a staged pipeline
that combines supervised fine-tuning on task-specific datasets with Group
Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, enabling self-supervised refinement
through iterative reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across four
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that R2-Reasoner reduces API costs by 86.85%
while maintaining or surpassing baseline accuracy. Our framework paves the way
for more cost-effective and adaptive LLM reasoning. The code is open-source at

*Xiaofei Xu,Xiuzhen Zhang,Ke Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 摘要提出了一种名为MisMitiFact的高效框架，用于生成基于事实的反驳内容以应对虚假信息。它通过轻量级的细粒度批评模型，显著提升了生成反馈的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚假信息对社会构成重大威胁，但手动事实核查成本高且难以扩展。大型语言模型（LLMs）在自动化生成反驳内容方面有潜力，但其容易产生非事实性信息。

Method: 提出MisMitiFact框架，利用轻量级的批评模型对LLM生成的内容进行细化，确保反驳内容基于证据。模型基于事实核查网站的数据训练。

Result: 实验表明，MisMitiFact生成的反驳内容质量与LLM自反馈相当，但反馈生成吞吐量提高了约5倍，且模型更轻量。

Conclusion: MisMitiFact是一种高效、成本效益高的解决方案，适合大规模虚假信息缓解。

Abstract: Fake news and misinformation poses a significant threat to society, making
efficient mitigation essential. However, manual fact-checking is costly and
lacks scalability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise in automating
counter-response generation to mitigate misinformation, but a critical
challenge lies in their tendency to hallucinate non-factual information.
Existing models mainly rely on LLM self-feedback to reduce hallucination, but
this approach is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose
MisMitiFact, Misinformation Mitigation grounded in Facts, an efficient
framework for generating fact-grounded counter-responses at scale. MisMitiFact
generates simple critique feedback to refine LLM outputs, ensuring responses
are grounded in evidence. We develop lightweight, fine-grained critique models
trained on data sourced from readily available fact-checking sites to identify
and correct errors in key elements such as numerals, entities, and topics in
LLM generations. Experiments show that MisMitiFact generates counter-responses
of comparable quality to LLMs' self-feedback while using significantly smaller
critique models. Importantly, it achieves ~5x increase in feedback generation
throughput, making it highly suitable for cost-effective, large-scale
misinformation mitigation. Code and LLM prompt templates are at

Motivation: 现有方法采用同质MoE-LoRA架构，但存在表示崩溃和专家负载不平衡的问题，限制了LLM的潜力。本文提出异构MoA方法以解决这些问题。

Method: 提出异构MoA方法，支持Soft MoA（加权融合所有专家输出）和Sparse MoA（稀疏激活贡献大的专家）。

Result: 实验表明，异构MoA在性能和参数效率上均优于同质MoE-LoRA方法。

Conclusion: 异构MoA方法通过动态整合多样结构的适配器专家，有效提升了LLM在下游任务中的知识迁移能力。

Abstract: Recent studies integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) to further enhance the performance of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods in Large Language Model (LLM) applications. Existing methods
employ \emph{homogeneous} MoE-LoRA architectures composed of LoRA experts with
either similar or identical structures and capacities. However, these
approaches often suffer from representation collapse and expert load imbalance,
which negatively impact the potential of LLMs. To address these challenges, we
propose a \emph{heterogeneous} \textbf{Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA)} approach.
This method dynamically integrates PEFT adapter experts with diverse
structures, leveraging their complementary representational capabilities to
foster expert specialization, thereby enhancing the effective transfer of
pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks. MoA supports two variants:
\textbf{(i)} \textit{Soft MoA} achieves fine-grained integration by performing
a weighted fusion of all expert outputs; \textbf{(ii)} \textit{Sparse MoA}
activates adapter experts sparsely based on their contribution, achieving this
with negligible performance degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that
heterogeneous MoA outperforms homogeneous MoE-LoRA methods in both performance
and parameter efficiency. Our project is available at

Result: 在多样化的数学、常识和科学问答基准测试中表现出色，实现了性能与计算效率的有效平衡。

Conclusion: DynamicMind通过动态调整推理模式，显著提升了大语言模型在零样本问答任务中的表现和效率。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) often struggle to dynamically adapt their
reasoning depth to varying task complexities, leading to suboptimal performance
or inefficient resource utilization. To address this, we introduce DynamicMind,
a novel tri-mode thinking system. DynamicMind empowers LLMs to autonomously
select between Fast, Normal, and Slow thinking modes for zero-shot question
answering (ZSQA) tasks through cognitive-inspired prompt engineering. Our
framework's core innovations include: (1) expanding the established
dual-process framework of fast and slow thinking into a tri-mode thinking
system involving a normal thinking mode to preserve the intrinsic capabilities
of LLM; (2) proposing the Thinking Density metric, which aligns computational
resource allocation with problem complexity; and (3) developing the Thinking
Mode Capacity (TMC) dataset and a lightweight Mind Router to predict the
optimal thinking mode. Extensive experiments across diverse mathematical,
commonsense, and scientific QA benchmarks demonstrate that DynamicMind achieves
superior ZSQA capabilities while establishing an effective trade-off between
performance and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在情感支持对话中，不明确的意图可能导致支持者采用不当策略，因此需要明确意图以指导支持过程。

Method: 提出IntentionESC框架，定义支持者意图，结合ICECoT机制模拟人类推理，并设计自动标注管道训练模型。

Result: 通过实验验证了框架的有效性，并提供了高质量的训练数据和评估方案。

Conclusion: IntentionESC和ICECoT显著提升了LLMs在情感支持对话中的表现，为未来研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: In emotional support conversations, unclear intentions can lead supporters to
employ inappropriate strategies, inadvertently imposing their expectations or
solutions on the seeker. Clearly defined intentions are essential for guiding
both the supporter's motivations and the overall emotional support process. In
this paper, we propose the Intention-centered Emotional Support Conversation
(IntentionESC) framework, which defines the possible intentions of supporters
in emotional support conversations, identifies key emotional state aspects for
inferring these intentions, and maps them to appropriate support strategies.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generating, they fundamentally
operate as probabilistic models trained on extensive datasets, lacking a true
understanding of human thought processes and intentions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Intention Centric Chain-of-Thought (ICECoT)
mechanism. ICECoT enables LLMs to mimic human reasoning by analyzing emotional
states, inferring intentions, and selecting suitable support strategies,
thereby generating more effective emotional support responses. To train the
model with ICECoT and integrate expert knowledge, we design an automated
annotation pipeline that produces high-quality training data. Furthermore, we
develop a comprehensive evaluation scheme to assess emotional support efficacy
and conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework. Our data and code
are available at https://github.com/43zxj/IntentionESC_ICECoT.

Abstract: Mathematics is often perceived as a complex subject by students, leading to
high failure rates in exams. To improve Mathematics skills, it is important to
provide sample questions for students to practice problem-solving. Manually
creating Math Word Problems (MWPs) is time consuming for tutors, because they
have to type in natural language while adhering to grammar and spelling rules
of the language. Existing Deep Learning techniques for MWP generation either
require a tutor to provide the initial portion of the MWP, and/or additional
information such as an equation. In this paper, we present an MWP generation
system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that overcome the need for
additional input - the only input to our system is the number of MWPs needed,
the grade and the type of question (e.g. addition, subtraction). Unlike the
existing LLM-based solutions for MWP generation, we carried out an extensive
set of experiments involving different LLMs, prompting strategies, techniques
to improve the diversity of questions, as well as techniques that employ human
feedback to improve LLM performance. Human and automated evaluations confirmed
that the generated MWPs are high in quality, with minimal spelling and grammar
issues. However, LLMs still struggle to generate questions that adhere to the
specified grade and question type requirements.

Motivation: 目前的心智理论推理方法限于特定场景（涉及世界状态变化），需开发更通用的方法来提升LLMs的心智理论能力。

Method: 提出“Shoes-of-Others (SoO)前缀法”，即在LLM输出前添加“让我们站在A的角度”的前缀，适用于更广泛的场景。

Result: 在无需世界状态变化的对话和叙事基准测试中，SoO前缀法在五种心理状态类别中一致提升了心智理论表现。

Conclusion: SoO前缀法通过激发真实思考，有效提升了LLMs的心智理论能力，适用于更广泛的场景。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Theory of Mind (ToM) in large language models
(LLMs) has not reached human-level performance yet. Since fine-tuning LLMs on
ToM datasets often degrades their generalization, several inference-time
methods have been proposed to enhance ToM in LLMs. However, existing
inference-time methods for ToM are specialized for inferring beliefs from
contexts involving changes in the world state. In this study, we present a new
inference-time method for ToM, Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, which makes
fewer assumptions about contexts and is applicable to broader scenarios. SoO
prefixing simply specifies the beginning of LLM outputs with ``Let's put
ourselves in A's shoes.'', where A denotes the target character's name. We
evaluate SoO prefixing on two benchmarks that assess ToM in conversational and
narrative contexts without changes in the world state and find that it
consistently improves ToM across five categories of mental states. Our analysis
suggests that SoO prefixing elicits faithful thoughts, thereby improving the
ToM performance.

involves a complex trade-off between privacy protection and information
preservation, where stringent anonymization methods can significantly impact
the text's utility for downstream applications. Evaluating the effectiveness of
text anonymization proves challenging from both privacy and utility
perspectives, as there is no universal benchmark that can comprehensively
assess anonymization techniques across diverse, and sometimes contradictory
contexts. We present Tau-Eval, an open-source framework for benchmarking text
anonymization methods through the lens of privacy and utility task sensitivity.

Conclusion: 文化语境和数据来源对LLM性能至关重要，为构建文化感知的多语言NLP系统提供参考。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate varying performance across languages
and cultural contexts. This study introduces a novel, culturally-rich,
multilingual dataset derived from video recordings of the Romanian game show
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" (Vrei s\u{a} fii Milionar?). We employed an
innovative process combining optical character recognition (OCR), automated
text extraction, and manual verification to collect question-answer pairs,
enriching them with metadata including question domain (e.g., biology,
history), cultural relevance (Romanian-specific vs. international), and
difficulty. Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs, including Romanian-adapted
models, on this dataset revealed significant performance disparities: models
consistently achieve higher accuracy (80-95%) on international questions
compared to Romanian-specific cultural questions (50-75%). We further
investigate these differences through experiments involving machine translation
of Romanian questions into English and cross-lingual tests using a comparable
dataset in French. Our findings underscore the impact of cultural context and
data source on LLM performance and offer practical insights for building
robust, culturally-aware multilingual NLP systems, especially in educational
domains. The dataset is publicly available at Hugging Face.

Result: 评估CoT有效性的指标准确率达89.2%，Dynamic CoT减少35%以上的Token消耗且保持高准确率。

Conclusion: 为CoT的机制提供了新见解，并提出了高效部署框架。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique has proven effective in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks.
However, the performance gains are inconsistent across different tasks, and the
underlying mechanism remains a long-standing research question. In this work,
we make a preliminary observation that the monotonicity of token probability
distributions may be correlated with the gains achieved through CoT reasoning.
Leveraging this insight, we propose two indicators based on the token
probability distribution to assess CoT effectiveness across different tasks. By
combining instance-level indicators with logistic regression model, we
introduce Dynamic CoT, a method that dynamically select between CoT and direct
answer. Furthermore, we extend Dynamic CoT to closed-source models by
transferring decision strategies learned from open-source models. Our
indicators for assessing CoT effectiveness achieve an accuracy of 89.2\%, and
Dynamic CoT reduces token consumption by more than 35\% while maintaining high
accuracy. Overall, our work offers a novel perspective on the underlying
mechanisms of CoT reasoning and provides a framework for its more efficient
deployment.

Result: 实验显示，仅用3k合成样本，AvR方法使LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct模型在AlpacaEval 2.0上的胜率提升超20%。

Conclusion: AvR方法有效解锁了大语言模型的递归推理潜力，具备测试时扩展能力。

Abstract: The OpenAI o1-series models have demonstrated that leveraging long-form Chain
of Thought (CoT) can substantially enhance performance. However, the recursive
thinking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain limited,
particularly in the absence of expert-curated data for distillation. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{AvR}: \textbf{Alignment via Refinement}, a novel
method aimed at unlocking the potential of LLMs for recursive reasoning through
long-form CoT. AvR introduces a refinement process that integrates criticism
and improvement actions, guided by differentiable learning techniques to
optimize \textbf{refinement-aware rewards}. As a result, the synthesized
multi-round data can be organized as a long refinement thought, further
enabling test-time scaling. Experimental results show that AvR significantly
outperforms conventional preference optimization methods. Notably, with only 3k
synthetic samples, our method boosts the performance of the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct
model by over 20\% in win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. Our code is available at

Method: 提出SR-DCR框架，结合基于置信度的自辩论，包括辩护者、批评者和法官模型，最终结合判决与置信度选择答案。

Result: 在ClashEval基准测试中，SR-DCR在误导性上下文中表现稳健，且在可信输入中保持准确性，优于传统辩论和仅依赖置信度的方法。

Conclusion: SR-DCR是一种轻量级框架，能有效提升语言模型的可靠性和事实一致性。

Abstract: Large language models frequently encounter conflicts between their parametric
knowledge and contextual input, often resulting in factual inconsistencies or
hallucinations. We propose Self-Reflective Debate for Contextual Reliability
(SR-DCR), a lightweight framework that integrates token-level self-confidence
with an asymmetric multi-agent debate to adjudicate such conflicts. A critic,
deprived of context, challenges a defender who argues from the given passage; a
judge model evaluates the debate and determines the context's reliability. The
final answer is selected by combining the verdict with model confidence.
Experiments on the ClashEval benchmark demonstrate that SR-DCR consistently
enhances robustness to misleading context while maintaining accuracy on
trustworthy inputs, outperforming both classical debate and confidence-only
baselines with minimal computational overhead. The code is available at
https://github.com/smiles724/Self-Reflective-Debates.

Result: 实验显示，FEEDER可减少20%以上训练数据，保持性能。

Conclusion: FEEDER高效且兼容多种下游演示选择策略。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) delivers strong
few-shot performance by choosing few-shot demonstrations from the entire
training data. However, existing ICL methods, which rely on similarity or
diversity scores to choose demonstrations, incur high computational costs due
to repeatedly retrieval from large-scale datasets for each query. To this end,
we propose FEEDER (FEw yet Essential Demonstration prE-selectoR), a novel
pre-selection framework that identifies a representative subset of
demonstrations containing the most representative examples in the training
data, tailored to specific LLMs. To construct this subset, we introduce the
"sufficiency" and "necessity" metrics in the pre-selection stage and design a
tree-based algorithm to identify representative examples efficiently. Once
pre-selected, this representative subset can effectively replace the full
training data, improving efficiency while maintaining comparable performance in
ICL. Additionally, our pre-selected subset also benefits fine-tuning LLMs,
where we introduce a bi-level optimization method that enhances training
efficiency without sacrificing performance. Experiments with LLMs ranging from
300M to 8B parameters show that FEEDER can reduce training data size by over
20% while maintaining performance and seamlessly integrating with various
downstream demonstration selection strategies in ICL.

Result: 现有方法只能解决MATP-BENCH中的部分问题，表明该基准为自动化定理证明研究提出了新的挑战。

Conclusion: MATP-BENCH为多模态自动化定理证明提供了一个开放的挑战，推动了相关领域的研究。

Abstract: Numerous theorems, such as those in geometry, are often presented in
multimodal forms (e.g., diagrams). Humans benefit from visual reasoning in such
settings, using diagrams to gain intuition and guide the proof process. Modern
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in solving a wide range of mathematical problems. However, the
potential of MLLMs as Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs), specifically in the
multimodal domain, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the
Multimodal Automated Theorem Proving benchmark (MATP-BENCH), a new Multimodal,
Multi-level, and Multi-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in this
role as multimodal automated theorem provers. MATP-BENCH consists of 1056
multimodal theorems drawn from high school, university, and competition-level
mathematics. All these multimodal problems are accompanied by formalizations in
Lean 4, Coq and Isabelle, thus making the benchmark compatible with a wide
range of theorem-proving frameworks. MATP-BENCH requires models to integrate
sophisticated visual understanding with mastery of a broad spectrum of
mathematical knowledge and rigorous symbolic reasoning to generate formal
proofs. We use MATP-BENCH to evaluate a variety of advanced multimodal language
models. Existing methods can only solve a limited number of the MATP-BENCH
problems, indicating that this benchmark poses an open challenge for research
on automated theorem proving.

TL;DR: CatShift是一个基于标签的数据集推断框架，利用大语言模型（LLM）的灾难性遗忘特性，检测可疑数据集是否曾用于模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型依赖大规模专有数据集，但未经授权使用可能导致版权问题。现有依赖概率对数的方法因模型隐藏信号而受限，亟需不依赖内部模型的检测方法。

Method: CatShift通过微调部分可疑数据集，观察模型输出的变化。与非成员验证集的输出变化对比，统计推断数据集是否曾被训练使用。

Result: 实验证明，CatShift在无法访问模型内部信号的情况下仍能有效检测数据集成员身份，为保护专有数据提供实用方案。

Conclusion: CatShift提供了一种轻量且鲁棒的方法，解决了在不依赖模型内部信息的情况下检测数据集成员身份的挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
by excelling at interpreting, reasoning about, and generating human language.
However, their reliance on large-scale, often proprietary datasets poses a
critical challenge: unauthorized usage of such data can lead to copyright
infringement and significant financial harm. Existing dataset-inference methods
typically depend on log probabilities to detect suspicious training material,
yet many leading LLMs have begun withholding or obfuscating these signals. This
reality underscores the pressing need for label-only approaches capable of
identifying dataset membership without relying on internal model logits.
  We address this gap by introducing CatShift, a label-only dataset-inference
framework that capitalizes on catastrophic forgetting: the tendency of an LLM
to overwrite previously learned knowledge when exposed to new data. If a
suspicious dataset was previously seen by the model, fine-tuning on a portion
of it triggers a pronounced post-tuning shift in the model's outputs;
conversely, truly novel data elicits more modest changes. By comparing the
model's output shifts for a suspicious dataset against those for a known
non-member validation set, we statistically determine whether the suspicious
set is likely to have been part of the model's original training corpus.
Extensive experiments on both open-source and API-based LLMs validate
CatShift's effectiveness in logit-inaccessible settings, offering a robust and
practical solution for safeguarding proprietary data.

TL;DR: 论文研究联邦学习中大语言模型（FedLLMs）的隐私风险，提出针对性的数据提取攻击方法，并量化其效果，呼吁加强防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FedLLMs在保护数据隐私的同时提升模型性能，但其记忆能力可能导致训练数据被提取，本研究旨在评估这种风险。

Method: 设计针对FedLLMs的提取攻击算法，基于攻击者仅访问单个客户端数据的现实威胁模型，并提出覆盖率和效率两种评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，该方法可提取高达56.57%的受害者专有个人可识别信息（PII），其中地址、生日和姓名最易泄露。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了FedLLMs的隐私漏洞，提出了新的评估框架，强调需开发更强防御策略。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of large language models (FedLLMs) presents a promising
approach for achieving strong model performance while preserving data privacy
in sensitive domains. However, the inherent memorization ability of LLMs makes
them vulnerable to training data extraction attacks. To investigate this risk,
we introduce simple yet effective extraction attack algorithms specifically
designed for FedLLMs. In contrast to prior "verbatim" extraction attacks, which
assume access to fragments from all training data, our approach operates under
a more realistic threat model, where the attacker only has access to a single
client's data and aims to extract previously unseen personally identifiable
information (PII) from other clients. This requires leveraging contextual
prefixes held by the attacker to generalize across clients. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our approaches, we propose two rigorous metrics-coverage rate
and efficiency-and extend a real-world legal dataset with PII annotations
aligned with CPIS, GDPR, and CCPA standards, achieving 89.9% human-verified
precision. Experimental results show that our method can extract up to 56.57%
of victim-exclusive PII, with "Address," "Birthday," and "Name" being the most
vulnerable categories. Our findings underscore the pressing need for robust
defense strategies and contribute a new benchmark and evaluation framework for
future research in privacy-preserving federated learning.

Motivation: 检测LLM生成的代码对安全、知识产权和学术诚信至关重要，但现有方法在区分生成代码与人类代码时存在不足。

Method: 利用任务条件概率分布，通过近似原始任务并计算token级熵（ATC），无需生成模型或原始提示。

Result: ATC在多个基准测试中达到最优性能，支持多种编程语言（Python、CPP、Java）。

Conclusion: 任务级条件对LLM生成代码检测至关重要，ATC为实际应用提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting Large Language Model (LLM)-generated code is a growing challenge
with implications for security, intellectual property, and academic integrity.
We investigate the role of conditional probability distributions in improving
zero-shot LLM-generated code detection, when considering both the code and the
corresponding task prompt that generated it. Our key insight is that when
evaluating the probability distribution of code tokens using an LLM, there is
little difference between LLM-generated and human-written code. However,
conditioning on the task reveals notable differences. This contrasts with
natural language text, where differences exist even in the unconditional
distributions. Leveraging this, we propose a novel zero-shot detection approach
that approximates the original task used to generate a given code snippet and
then evaluates token-level entropy under the approximated task conditioning
(ATC). We further provide a mathematical intuition, contextualizing our method
relative to previous approaches. ATC requires neither access to the generator
LLM nor the original task prompts, making it practical for real-world
applications. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves state-of-the-art
results across benchmarks and generalizes across programming languages,
including Python, CPP, and Java. Our findings highlight the importance of
task-level conditioning for LLM-generated code detection. The supplementary
materials and code are available at https://github.com/maorash/ATC, including
the dataset gathering implementation, to foster further research in this area.

TL;DR: MIRIAD是一个大规模、经过整理的医学QA对数据集，旨在通过RAG提升LLMs在医疗决策中的准确性和抗幻觉能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法依赖非结构化的医学文本，效率低且噪声多，需系统化整理医学知识以提高LLMs的应用效果。

Method: 采用半自动化流程（LLM生成、过滤、标注）构建MIRIAD，将医学文献转化为QA对形式，实现针对性检索。

Result: MIRIAD在医学QA基准测试中提升LLMs准确率6.7%，抗幻觉能力提高22.5-37%，并开发了交互式知识图谱MIRIAD-Atlas。

Conclusion: MIRIAD为医疗LLM应用提供可靠知识基础，支持信息检索、RAG优化和聊天接口，推动医疗AI的可靠性。

Abstract: LLMs are bound to transform healthcare with advanced decision support and
flexible chat assistants. However, LLMs are prone to generate inaccurate
medical content. To ground LLMs in high-quality medical knowledge, LLMs have
been equipped with external knowledge via RAG, where unstructured medical
knowledge is split into small text chunks that can be selectively retrieved and
integrated into the LLMs context. Yet, existing RAG pipelines rely on raw,
unstructured medical text, which can be noisy, uncurated and difficult for LLMs
to effectively leverage. Systematic approaches to organize medical knowledge to
best surface it to LLMs are generally lacking. To address these challenges, we
introduce MIRIAD, a large-scale, curated corpus of 5,821,948 medical QA pairs,
each rephrased from and grounded in a passage from peer-reviewed medical
literature using a semi-automated pipeline combining LLM generation, filtering,
grounding, and human annotation. Unlike prior medical corpora, which rely on
unstructured text, MIRIAD encapsulates web-scale medical knowledge in an
operationalized query-response format, which enables more targeted retrieval.
Experiments on challenging medical QA benchmarks show that augmenting LLMs with
MIRIAD improves accuracy up to 6.7% compared to unstructured RAG baselines with
the same source corpus and with the same amount of retrieved text. Moreover,
MIRIAD improved the ability of LLMs to detect medical hallucinations by 22.5 to
37% (increase in F1 score). We further introduce MIRIAD-Atlas, an interactive
map of MIRIAD spanning 56 medical disciplines, enabling clinical users to
visually explore, search, and refine medical knowledge. MIRIAD promises to
unlock a wealth of down-stream applications, including medical information
retrievers, enhanced RAG applications, and knowledge-grounded chat interfaces,
which ultimately enables more reliable LLM applications in healthcare.

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何通过大型语言模型(LLM)生成SQL查询的技术，提出一种基于强化学习的方法，通过数据库引擎的反馈优化模型性能，显著提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以通过模型与数据库引擎的交互（而非传统的有监督微调）来优化SQL生成的准确性。

Method: 将问题构建为强化学习任务，利用执行反馈（奖励机制）在GRPO框架下优化模型。

Result: 仅使用弱监督（问答对），RL调节将SQL生成准确率从31.49提升至49.83，错误率从25.43%降至14.71%，接近更大模型的性能。

Conclusion: 执行反馈能有效提升LLM的符号推理能力，展示了其在代码生成中的潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of code generation with a large language
model (LLM), with a focus on generating SQL queries from natural language
questions. We ask: Instead of using supervised fine tuning with text-code
pairs, can we tune a model by having it interact with a database engine? We
frame this problem as a reinforcement learning problem where the model receives
execution-based feedback from the environment in the form of scalar rewards.
These rewards penalize execution failures and assign positive values when a
query returns a correct answer. We use the rewards within the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework. We use a tabular reasoning benchmark to
test and evaluate our findings. We find that with only weak supervision in the
form of question-answer pairs, RL-tuning improves the accuracy of model
generated SQL code from 31.49 to 49.83 while reducing error percentage from
25.43% to 14.71%. This improvement allowed the model nearly match the
performance performance to the larger SQLCoder-70B model. Our work demonstrates
the potential of using execution-based feedback to improve symbolic reasoning
capabilities of LLMs.

Motivation: 动机：探讨LLMs能否在主观任务（如仇恨言论和冒犯性语言检测）中捕捉多视角并反映标注分歧，解决传统聚合标签方法掩盖的标注不一致问题。

Method: 方法：采用上下文学习（ICL）的零样本和少样本设置，评估四种开源LLMs和三种标签建模策略，包括聚合硬标签、分离硬标签和软标签。

Result: 结果：零样本设置中LLMs能生成多视角结果，少样本设置中表现不佳；提示设计和示例选择对性能影响显著，示例排序影响较小。

Conclusion: 结论：研究揭示了LLMs建模主观性的挑战，强调了构建更具视角意识和社会智能模型的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on NLP
classification tasks. However, they typically rely on aggregated labels-often
via majority voting-which can obscure the human disagreement inherent in
subjective annotations. This study examines whether LLMs can capture multiple
perspectives and reflect annotator disagreement in subjective tasks such as
hate speech and offensive language detection. We use in-context learning (ICL)
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, evaluating four open-source LLMs across
three label modeling strategies: aggregated hard labels, and disaggregated hard
and soft labels. In few-shot prompting, we assess demonstration selection
methods based on textual similarity (BM25, PLM-based), annotation disagreement
(entropy), a combined ranking, and example ordering strategies (random vs.
curriculum-based). Results show that multi-perspective generation is viable in
zero-shot settings, while few-shot setups often fail to capture the full
spectrum of human judgments. Prompt design and demonstration selection notably
affect performance, though example ordering has limited impact. These findings
highlight the challenges of modeling subjectivity with LLMs and the importance
of building more perspective-aware, socially intelligent models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语音搜索和重新评分的语音纠正系统，用于改进端到端语音识别模型对不常见或新电影标题的识别效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高质量的训练数据难以获取，端到端语音识别模型对不常见电影标题的识别效果较差，因此需要一种方法来提升识别准确率。

Method: 提出了一个包含语音搜索和重新评分组件的语音纠正系统，生成的语音备选方案可能被端到端系统忽略。

Result: 该方法在常见电影标题的基准测试中相对提高了4.4%至7.6%的单词错误率。

Conclusion: 提出的语音纠正系统有效改善了端到端语音识别模型对不常见内容的识别效果。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are trained using
paired audio-text samples that are expensive to obtain, since high-quality
ground-truth data requires human annotators. Voice search applications, such as
digital media players, leverage ASR to allow users to search by voice as
opposed to an on-screen keyboard. However, recent or infrequent movie titles
may not be sufficiently represented in the E2E ASR system's training data, and
hence, may suffer poor recognition.
  In this paper, we propose a phonetic correction system that consists of (a) a
phonetic search based on the ASR model's output that generates phonetic
alternatives that may not be considered by the E2E system, and (b) a rescorer
component that combines the ASR model recognition and the phonetic
alternatives, and select a final system output.
  We find that our approach improves word error rate between 4.4 and 7.6%
relative on benchmarks of popular movie titles over a series of competitive
baselines.

Motivation: 探讨NLI模型在处理条件句中的细粒度预设推理时的局限性，填补研究空白。

Method: 引入CONFER数据集，评估四种NLI模型及大型语言模型（LLMs）在零样本和少样本设置下的表现。

Result: NLI模型在条件句中处理预设推理时表现不佳，现有数据集的微调未见明显改进。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究以提升NLI模型在条件推理中的表现。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining whether a
sentence pair represents entailment, contradiction, or a neutral relationship.
While NLI models perform well on many inference tasks, their ability to handle
fine-grained pragmatic inferences, particularly presupposition in conditionals,
remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce CONFER, a novel dataset
designed to evaluate how NLI models process inference in conditional sentences.
We assess the performance of four NLI models, including two pre-trained models,
to examine their generalization to conditional reasoning. Additionally, we
evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, LLaMA, Gemma, and
DeepSeek-R1, in zero-shot and few-shot prompting settings to analyze their
ability to infer presuppositions with and without prior context. Our findings
indicate that NLI models struggle with presuppositional reasoning in
conditionals, and fine-tuning on existing NLI datasets does not necessarily
improve their performance.

Result: 三个掩码语言模型的词嵌入表现出预期的语义敏感性，验证了工具的有效性。

Conclusion: 工具在分析词嵌入语义解释方面具有实用价值，为进一步研究提供了支持。

Abstract: We introduce semantic-features, an extensible, easy-to-use library based on
Chronis et al. (2023) for studying contextualized word embeddings of LMs by
projecting them into interpretable spaces. We apply this tool in an experiment
where we measure the contextual effect of the choice of dative construction
(prepositional or double object) on the semantic interpretation of utterances
(Bresnan, 2007). Specifically, we test whether "London" in "I sent London the
letter." is more likely to be interpreted as an animate referent (e.g., as the
name of a person) than in "I sent the letter to London." To this end, we devise
a dataset of 450 sentence pairs, one in each dative construction, with
recipients being ambiguous with respect to person-hood vs. place-hood. By
applying semantic-features, we show that the contextualized word embeddings of
three masked language models show the expected sensitivities. This leaves us
optimistic about the usefulness of our tool.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型在执行图表代码时的失败原因，是模型限制还是单提示设计所致。

Method: 提出轻量级多代理流程，分离起草、执行、修复和判断步骤，仅使用现成的GPT-4o-mini模型。

Result: 在Text2Chart31基准上，系统将执行错误率降至4.5%；在ChartX基准上为4.6%，但图表可访问性和语义保真仍需改进。

Conclusion: 未来研究应从执行可靠性转向提升图表美学、语义保真和可访问性。

Abstract: Large language models can translate natural-language chart descriptions into
runnable code, yet approximately 15\% of the generated scripts still fail to
execute, even after supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We
investigate whether this persistent error rate stems from model limitations or
from reliance on a single-prompt design. To explore this, we propose a
lightweight multi-agent pipeline that separates drafting, execution, repair,
and judgment, using only an off-the-shelf GPT-4o-mini model. On the
\textsc{Text2Chart31} benchmark, our system reduces execution errors to 4.5\%
within three repair iterations, outperforming the strongest fine-tuned baseline
by nearly 5 percentage points while requiring significantly less compute.
Similar performance is observed on the \textsc{ChartX} benchmark, with an error
rate of 4.6\%, demonstrating strong generalization. Under current benchmarks,
execution success appears largely solved. However, manual review reveals that 6
out of 100 sampled charts contain hallucinations, and an LLM-based
accessibility audit shows that only 33.3\% (\textsc{Text2Chart31}) and 7.2\%
(\textsc{ChartX}) of generated charts satisfy basic colorblindness guidelines.
These findings suggest that future work should shift focus from execution
reliability toward improving chart aesthetics, semantic fidelity, and
accessibility.

Result: Llama3-8B在包含VP评估标准的提示下表现最优，性能接近GPT-4，且专家知识比CoT技术对小模型更有效。

Conclusion: 在语音钓鱼检测中，将人类专家知识融入提示比使用CoT技术对小语言模型更有效。

Abstract: We develop a voice phishing (VP) detector by fine-tuning Llama3, a
representative open-source, small language model (LM). In the prompt, we
provide carefully-designed VP evaluation criteria and apply the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. To evaluate the robustness of LMs and
highlight differences in their performance, we construct an adversarial test
dataset that places the models under challenging conditions. Moreover, to
address the lack of VP transcripts, we create transcripts by referencing
existing or new types of VP techniques. We compare cases where evaluation
criteria are included, the CoT technique is applied, or both are used together.
In the experiment, our results show that the Llama3-8B model, fine-tuned with a
dataset that includes a prompt with VP evaluation criteria, yields the best
performance among small LMs and is comparable to that of a GPT-4-based VP
detector. These findings indicate that incorporating human expert knowledge
into the prompt is more effective than using the CoT technique for small LMs in
VP detection.

Conclusion: 当前模型在开放性推理中存在局限性，未来需开发更具通用性和创造性的推理系统。

Abstract: Puzzlehunts are a genre of complex, multi-step puzzles lacking well-defined
problem definitions. In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks
consisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to
discover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and
iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,
exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent
progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings
remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a
large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess
step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is
annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive
skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic
analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,
with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise
accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that
fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from
4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near
zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,
are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack
sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release
PuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on
building more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems.

theoretical, computational, and applied physics when properly integrated with
domain knowledge and toolbox. We analyze current LLM capabilities for physics
-- from mathematical reasoning to code generation -- identifying critical gaps
in physical intuition, constraint satisfaction, and reliable reasoning. We
envision future physics-specialized LLMs that could handle multimodal data,
propose testable hypotheses, and design experiments. Realizing this vision
requires addressing fundamental challenges: ensuring physical consistency, and
developing robust verification methods. We call for collaborative efforts
between physics and AI communities to help advance scientific discovery in
physics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种基于提示的数据增强技术（DDA和CSE）及集成策略，以解决在线性别歧视检测中的数据稀缺和语言细微差别问题，并在EDOS数据集上实现了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线性别歧视检测面临数据稀缺和语言细微差别两大挑战，现有系统难以泛化且标注不一致。

Method: 提出DDA和CSE两种数据增强技术，并结合多语言模型的集成策略。

Result: 在EDOS数据集上，二元分类（Task A）和细粒度分类（Task C）的宏F1分别提升1.5和4.1分。

Conclusion: 该方法显著优化了性别歧视检测的性能，特别是针对数据稀疏和类别模糊问题。

Abstract: The detection of sexism in online content remains an open problem, as harmful
language disproportionately affects women and marginalized groups. While
automated systems for sexism detection have been developed, they still face two
key challenges: data sparsity and the nuanced nature of sexist language. Even
in large, well-curated datasets like the Explainable Detection of Online Sexism
(EDOS), severe class imbalance hinders model generalization. Additionally, the
overlapping and ambiguous boundaries of fine-grained categories introduce
substantial annotator disagreement, reflecting the difficulty of interpreting
nuanced expressions of sexism. To address these challenges, we propose two
prompt-based data augmentation techniques: Definition-based Data Augmentation
(DDA), which leverages category-specific definitions to generate
semantically-aligned synthetic examples, and Contextual Semantic Expansion
(CSE), which targets systematic model errors by enriching examples with
task-specific semantic features. To further improve reliability in fine-grained
classification, we introduce an ensemble strategy that resolves prediction ties
by aggregating complementary perspectives from multiple language models. Our
experimental evaluation on the EDOS dataset demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance across all tasks, with notable improvements of macro F1 by 1.5
points for binary classification (Task A) and 4.1 points for fine-grained
classification (Task C).

*Yi Sui,Chaozhuo Li,Chen Zhang,Dawei song,Qiuchi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DSSP-RAG通过双流知识整合框架，解决了外部知识与LLMs内部知识冲突的问题，提高了生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG方法在知识冲突时性能下降，LLMs缺乏解决机制，需改进。

Method: 引入混合注意力机制分离共享与私有语义，提出认知不确定性检测和能量商降噪。

Result: 实验显示DSSP-RAG在冲突解决和性能上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DSSP-RAG有效整合双流知识，提升生成稳定性和准确性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a cost-effective approach to mitigate
the hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating the
retrieved external knowledge into the generation process. However, external
knowledge may conflict with the parametric knowledge of LLMs. Furthermore,
current LLMs lack inherent mechanisms for resolving such knowledge conflicts,
making traditional RAG methods suffer from degraded performance and stability.
Thus, we propose a Dual-Stream Knowledge-Augmented Framework for Shared-Private
Semantic Synergy (DSSP-RAG). Central to the framework is a novel approach that
refines self-attention into a mixed-attention, distinguishing shared and
private semantics for a controlled internal-external knowledge integration. To
effectively facilitate DSSP in RAG, we further introduce an unsupervised
hallucination detection method based on cognitive uncertainty, ensuring the
necessity of introducing knowledge, and an Energy Quotient (EQ) based on
attention difference matrices to reduce noise in the retrieved external
knowledge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that DSSP-RAG can
effectively resolve conflicts and enhance the complementarity of dual-stream
knowledge, leading to superior performance over strong baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种名为Cartridge的离线训练KV缓存方法，通过自学习训练方案替代传统ICL，显著降低内存消耗并提升吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于大上下文的ICL方法内存消耗大且成本高，寻求更高效的解决方案。

Method: 训练离线KV缓存（Cartridge），使用自学习方法生成合成对话并以上下文蒸馏目标训练。

Result: Cartridge在性能与ICL相当的同时，内存减少38.6倍，吞吐量提升26.4倍，且支持更长上下文。

Conclusion: 自学习训练的Cartridge是一种高效替代ICL的方案，具备成本低和可组合性优势。

Abstract: Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text
corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the
entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL).
Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is
costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with
input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on
each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a
Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge
can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However,
we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token
prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose
self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations
about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.
We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of
ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context
benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while
using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also
extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on
MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference
time without retraining.

TL;DR: AdvSumm通过对抗训练框架减少文本摘要中的偏见，同时保持摘要质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在文本摘要中表现出色，但存在预训练数据中的偏见问题，导致下游任务输出不公平。

Method: AdvSumm引入Perturber组件，在序列到序列模型的嵌入层应用梯度引导扰动，提升模型对输入变化的鲁棒性。

Result: AdvSumm有效减少了姓名-国籍偏见和政治框架偏见，且优于标准Transformer和回译等数据增强方法。

Conclusion: AdvSumm是一种领域无关的训练框架，可显著减少摘要中的偏见而不牺牲质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications.
However, these systems often inherit associative and framing biases from
pre-training data, leading to inappropriate or unfair outputs in downstream
tasks. In this work, we present AdvSumm (Adversarial Summarization), a
domain-agnostic training framework designed to mitigate bias in text
summarization through improved generalization. Inspired by adversarial
robustness, AdvSumm introduces a novel Perturber component that applies
gradient-guided perturbations at the embedding level of Sequence-to-Sequence
models, enhancing the model's robustness to input variations. We empirically
demonstrate that AdvSumm effectively reduces different types of bias in
summarization-specifically, name-nationality bias and political framing
bias-without compromising summarization quality. Compared to standard
transformers and data augmentation techniques like back-translation, AdvSumm
achieves stronger bias mitigation performance across benchmark datasets.

Method: 通过迭代与专家讨论制定注释指南，标注500篇PubMed摘要和140篇EBM-NLP语料库摘要，训练PubMedBERT模型。

Result: 构建了EvidenceOutcomes数据集，标注者一致率为0.76；PubMedBERT模型在实体和标记级别的F1得分分别为0.69和0.76。

Conclusion: EvidenceOutcomes可作为未来机器学习算法开发和测试的共享基准。

Abstract: The fundamental process of evidence extraction and synthesis in
evidence-based medicine involves extracting PICO (Population, Intervention,
Comparison, and Outcome) elements from biomedical literature. However,
Outcomes, being the most complex elements, are often neglected or
oversimplified in existing benchmarks. To address this issue, we present
EvidenceOutcomes, a novel, large, annotated corpus of clinically meaningful
outcomes extracted from biomedical literature. We first developed a robust
annotation guideline for extracting clinically meaningful outcomes from text
through iteration and discussion with clinicians and Natural Language
Processing experts. Then, three independent annotators annotated the Results
and Conclusions sections of a randomly selected sample of 500 PubMed abstracts
and 140 PubMed abstracts from the existing EBM-NLP corpus. This resulted in
EvidenceOutcomes with high-quality annotations of an inter-rater agreement of
0.76. Additionally, our fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, applied to these 500
PubMed abstracts, achieved an F1-score of 0.69 at the entity level and 0.76 at
the token level on the subset of 140 PubMed abstracts from the EBM-NLP corpus.
EvidenceOutcomes can serve as a shared benchmark to develop and test future
machine learning algorithms to extract clinically meaningful outcomes from
biomedical abstracts.

Motivation: 虽然生成式大型语言模型在多种NLP任务中表现优异，但在语义角色标注（SRL）任务中仍落后于编码器-解码器模型，论文旨在缩小这一差距。

Method: 引入检索增强生成机制以利用外部语言知识，以及自校正机制以识别和修正不一致的SRL输出。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的SRL基准测试（CPB1.0、CoNLL-2009和CoNLL-2012）中，该方法在中英文任务上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该研究首次展示了生成式大型语言模型在SRL任务中超越编码器-解码器模型的潜力。

Abstract: Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a crucial task of natural language processing
(NLP). Although generative decoder-based large language models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks, they still lag behind
state-of-the-art encoder-decoder (BERT-like) models in SRL. In this work, we
seek to bridge this gap by equipping LLMs for SRL with two mechanisms: (a)
retrieval-augmented generation and (b) self-correction. The first mechanism
enables LLMs to leverage external linguistic knowledge such as predicate and
argument structure descriptions, while the second allows LLMs to identify and
correct inconsistent SRL outputs. We conduct extensive experiments on three
widely-used benchmarks of SRL (CPB1.0, CoNLL-2009, and CoNLL-2012). Results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
Chinese and English, marking the first successful application of LLMs to
surpass encoder-decoder approaches in SRL.

Motivation: 现有的基于大型语言模型的方法在生成临床长文本时表现不足，尤其是在有限患者信息的情况下。因此，提出了R2AG来解决这一挑战，通过强化学习和知识图谱检索来提升长文本生成的质量。

Method: R2AG使用强化学习训练检索器，从医学知识图谱中检索推理路径，以提供语义指导。同时，提出了GRO方法，通过组相对奖励优化检索质量，鼓励更深层次的推理。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV-Note数据集上的实验表明，R2AG在临床有效性和自然语言生成指标上优于基线方法，尤其在稀疏输入情况下填补语义空白的能力突出。

Conclusion: R2AG通过强化检索和语义指导，显著提升了长文本临床生成的性能，同时减少了临床误解的风险。

Abstract: Clinical note generation aims to automatically produce free-text summaries of
a patient's condition and diagnostic process, with discharge instructions being
a representative long-form example. While recent large language model
(LLM)-based methods pre-trained on general clinical corpora show promise in
clinical text generation, they fall short in producing long-form notes from
limited patient information. In this paper, we propose R2AG, the first
reinforced retriever for long-form discharge instruction generation based on
pre-admission data. R2AG is trained with reinforcement learning to retrieve
reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph, providing explicit semantic
guidance to the LLM. To bridge the information gap, we propose Group-Based
Retriever Optimization (GRO) which improves retrieval quality with
group-relative rewards, encouraging reasoning leaps for deeper inference by the
LLM. Comprehensive experiments on the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset show that R2AG
outperforms baselines in both clinical efficacy and natural language generation
metrics. Further analysis reveals that R2AG fills semantic gaps in sparse input
scenarios, and retrieved reasoning paths help LLMs avoid clinical
misinterpretation by focusing on key evidence and following coherent reasoning.

Method: 提出自适应语义感知典型性采样（ASTS），融入动态熵阈值、多目标评分和奖惩调整，提升生成质量。

Result: 实验表明，ASTS在故事生成和摘要任务中表现优异，降低重复性，增强语义一致性和流畅性。

Conclusion: ASTS是一种高效且优于现有采样技术的解码方法，适用于多样化和连贯的文本生成任务。

Abstract: This chapter explores advancements in decoding strategies for large language
models (LLMs), focusing on enhancing the Locally Typical Sampling (LTS)
algorithm. Traditional decoding methods, such as top-k and nucleus sampling,
often struggle to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation.
To address these challenges, Adaptive Semantic-Aware Typicality Sampling (ASTS)
is proposed as an improved version of LTS, incorporating dynamic entropy
thresholding, multi-objective scoring, and reward-penalty adjustments. ASTS
ensures contextually coherent and diverse text generation while maintaining
computational efficiency. Its performance is evaluated across multiple
benchmarks, including story generation and abstractive summarization, using
metrics such as perplexity, MAUVE, and diversity scores. Experimental results
demonstrate that ASTS outperforms existing sampling techniques by reducing
repetition, enhancing semantic alignment, and improving fluency.

Motivation: 德语大规模公开语料库的缺乏限制了语言趋势和社会问题（如性别偏见）的研究，因此需要构建一个全面的资源。

Method: 构建了taz2024full语料库，并使用可扩展的结构化分析流程研究了性别代表性。

Result: 研究发现男性在报道中被过度代表，但近年来逐渐趋向平衡。语料库为研究演员提及、情感和语言框架提供了基础。

Conclusion: taz2024full语料库支持多种应用，并免费开放以促进德语NLP的包容性和可重复研究。

Abstract: Open-access corpora are essential for advancing natural language processing
(NLP) and computational social science (CSS). However, large-scale resources
for German remain limited, restricting research on linguistic trends and
societal issues such as gender bias. We present taz2024full, the largest
publicly available corpus of German newspaper articles to date, comprising over
1.8 million texts from taz, spanning 1980 to 2024.
  As a demonstration of the corpus's utility for bias and discrimination
research, we analyse gender representation across four decades of reporting. We
find a consistent overrepresentation of men, but also a gradual shift toward
more balanced coverage in recent years. Using a scalable, structured analysis
pipeline, we provide a foundation for studying actor mentions, sentiment, and
linguistic framing in German journalistic texts.
  The corpus supports a wide range of applications, from diachronic language
analysis to critical media studies, and is freely available to foster inclusive
and reproducible research in German-language NLP.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了电商场景中独特的性别偏见维度，补充了现有AI危害框架（如排他性规范、刻板印象和性能差异）的理解。

Abstract: While gender bias in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively
studied in many domains, uses of LLMs in e-commerce remain largely unexamined
and may reveal novel forms of algorithmic bias and harm. Our work investigates
this space, developing data-driven taxonomic categories of gender bias in the
context of product description generation, which we situate with respect to
existing general purpose harms taxonomies. We illustrate how AI-generated
product descriptions can uniquely surface gender biases in ways that require
specialized detection and mitigation approaches. Further, we quantitatively
analyze issues corresponding to our taxonomic categories in two models used for
this task -- GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM -- demonstrating that these
forms of bias commonly occur in practice. Our results illuminate unique,
under-explored dimensions of gender bias, such as assumptions about clothing
size, stereotypical bias in which features of a product are advertised, and
differences in the use of persuasive language. These insights contribute to our
understanding of three types of AI harms identified by current frameworks:
exclusionary norms, stereotyping, and performance disparities, particularly for
the context of e-commerce.

Motivation: 当前LLMs在动态图（即真实世界演化的网络）上的应用相对较少，尤其是针对真实时序图的研究尚未深入。

Method: TGTalker利用时序图中的“近期偏好”特性提取结构信息，并将其转化为自然语言供LLMs使用，同时引入时序邻居作为预测的附加信息。

Conclusion: TGTalker不仅填补了LLMs在动态图上的研究空白，还为时序链接预测的可解释性开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently driven significant advancements in
Natural Language Processing and various other applications. While a broad range
of literature has explored the graph-reasoning capabilities of LLMs, including
their use of predictors on graphs, the application of LLMs to dynamic graphs --
real world evolving networks -- remains relatively unexplored. Recent work
studies synthetic temporal graphs generated by random graph models, but
applying LLMs to real-world temporal graphs remains an open question. To
address this gap, we introduce Temporal Graph Talker (TGTalker), a novel
temporal graph learning framework designed for LLMs. TGTalker utilizes the
recency bias in temporal graphs to extract relevant structural information,
converted to natural language for LLMs, while leveraging temporal neighbors as
additional information for prediction. TGTalker demonstrates competitive link
prediction capabilities compared to existing Temporal Graph Neural Network
(TGNN) models. Across five real-world networks, TGTalker performs competitively
with state-of-the-art temporal graph methods while consistently outperforming
popular models such as TGN and HTGN. Furthermore, TGTalker generates textual
explanations for each prediction, thus opening up exciting new directions in
explainability and interpretability for temporal link prediction. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/shenyangHuang/TGTalker.

Conclusion: 研究通过技术创新解决了ASR瓶颈问题，为医疗电话审核自动化提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Automating benefit verification phone calls saves time in healthcare and
helps patients receive treatment faster. It is critical to obtain highly
accurate information in these phone calls, as it can affect a patient's
healthcare journey. Given the noise in phone call transcripts, we have a
two-stage system that involves a post-call review phase for potentially noisy
fields, where human reviewers manually verify the extracted
data$\unicode{x2013}$a labor-intensive task. To automate this stage, we
introduce Auto Review, which significantly reduces manual effort while
maintaining a high bar for accuracy. This system, being highly reliant on call
transcripts, suffers a performance bottleneck due to automatic speech
recognition (ASR) issues. This problem is further exacerbated by the use of
domain-specific jargon in the calls. In this work, we propose a second-stage
postprocessing pipeline for accurate information extraction. We improve
accuracy by using multiple ASR alternatives and a pseudo-labeling approach that
does not require manually corrected transcripts. Experiments with
general-purpose large language models and feature-based model pipelines
demonstrate substantial improvements in the quality of corrected call
transcripts, thereby enhancing the efficiency of Auto Review.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展上下文长度是LLMs的关键需求，但由于注意力机制的二次复杂度，长上下文建模效率低。KV缓存压缩是解决此问题的关键方法，但现有方法未考虑KV缓存的不对称性。

Method: 提出AsymKV框架，结合基于同质性的键合并和数学证明的无损值压缩，实现训练自由的KV缓存压缩。

Result: AsymKV在多项任务和基础模型上表现优于现有方法，例如在LLaMA3.1-8B上，LongBench平均得分43.95，显著优于H$_2$O（38.89）。

Conclusion: KV缓存的不对称性是现有压缩方法的局限性，AsymKV通过针对性设计显著提升了长上下文建模的效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the critical
importance of extending context length, yet the quadratic complexity of
attention mechanisms poses significant challenges for efficient long-context
modeling. KV cache compression has emerged as a key approach to address this
challenge. Through extensive empirical analysis, we reveal a fundamental yet
previously overlooked asymmetry in KV caches: while adjacent keys receive
similar attention weights (local homogeneity), adjacent values demonstrate
distinct heterogeneous distributions. This key-value asymmetry reveals a
critical limitation in existing compression methods that treat keys and values
uniformly. To address the limitation, we propose a training-free compression
framework (AsymKV) that combines homogeneity-based key merging with a
mathematically proven lossless value compression. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AsymKV consistently outperforms existing long-context methods
across various tasks and base models. For example, on LLaMA3.1-8B, AsymKV
achieves an average score of 43.95 on LongBench, surpassing SOTA methods like
H$_2$O (38.89) by a large margin.

correspond to human labels.
  We then extract features from Wordle games that can predict user amusement.
We demonstrate that the features indeed provide a (weak) signal that predicts
user amusement as predicted by GPT-3.5.
  Our results indicate that user amusement at Wordle games can be predicted
computationally to some extent. We explore which features of the game

TL;DR: 提出了MLLM-CL基准，结合参数隔离和路由机制解决多模态大模型在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大模型在动态现实场景中难以持续集成新知识与能力，现有基准和方法存在局限。

Method: 采用参数隔离和基于MLLM的路由机制，防止灾难性干扰。

Result: 实验显示该方法能最小化遗忘，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MLLM-CL基准和方法有效解决了多模态大模型持续学习中的关键问题。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language
understanding but face challenges in adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios
that require continuous integration of new knowledge and skills. While
continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and
methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL,
a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the
former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation
across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID
scenarios with emerging model ability. Methodologically, we propose preventing
catastrophic interference through parameter isolation, along with an MLLM-based
routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can
integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal
forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods.

*Niruthiha Selvanayagam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究利用无监督机器学习技术分析儿童语言发展轨迹，区分特定语言障碍（SLI）与非SLI儿童，发现SLI主要表现为生产能力的降低而非句法复杂性的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SLI诊断方法依赖标准化评估，可能忽略细微发展模式。研究旨在通过机器学习更准确地早期识别SLI并为干预提供依据。

Method: 采用主成分分析（PCA）和聚类技术，分析来自三个语料库的1,163名儿童的叙事样本，评估64个语言特征。

Result: 研究发现两个主要集群：高产低SLI组和低产高句法复杂性高SLI组，支持语言能力的连续性模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明SLI主要表现为生产能力不足，挑战了传统分类诊断框架，展示无监督学习在优化诊断与干预中的潜力。

Abstract: Specific Language Impairment (SLI) affects approximately 7 percent of
children, presenting as isolated language deficits despite normal cognitive
abilities, sensory systems, and supportive environments. Traditional diagnostic
approaches often rely on standardized assessments, which may overlook subtle
developmental patterns. This study aims to identify natural language
development trajectories in children with and without SLI using unsupervised
machine learning techniques, providing insights for early identification and
targeted interventions. Narrative samples from 1,163 children aged 4-16 years
across three corpora (Conti-Ramsden 4, ENNI, and Gillam) were analyzed using
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering. A total of 64 linguistic
features were evaluated to uncover developmental trajectories and distinguish
linguistic profiles. Two primary clusters emerged: (1) high language production
with low SLI prevalence, and (2) limited production but higher syntactic
complexity with higher SLI prevalence. Additionally, boundary cases exhibited
intermediate traits, supporting a continuum model of language abilities.
Findings suggest SLI manifests primarily through reduced production capacity
rather than syntactic complexity deficits. The results challenge categorical
diagnostic frameworks and highlight the potential of unsupervised learning
techniques for refining diagnostic criteria and intervention strategies.

*Petr Máša*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于增强关联规则的方法，通过规则到文本的转换，将生成的规则集融入大语言模型（LLM）的检索增强生成（RAG）技术中，显著提升了基于数据集的问答效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLM）虽然取得巨大进展，但基于数据库的问答仍存在安全性和可控性问题。希望通过可解释的机器学习方法（如增强关联规则）改进回答质量，并与安全技术（如RAG）结合。

Method: 提出了一种方法：首先生成基于知识模式的规则集，然后将规则转换为文本形式，最后将这些文本作为RAG融入LLM。在实验中对比了ChatGPT（包括使用代理的情况）。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在基于数据集的问答任务上显著优于ChatGPT，并且探索了生成规则的策略对效果的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅效果显著，未来还可通过引入更多模式、将规则挖掘作为代理等方式进一步优化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are achieving significant progress almost every
moment now. Many advanced techniques have been introduced and widely accepted,
like retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG), agents, and tools. Tools can
query the database to answer questions from structured data files or perform
groupings or other statistics. This unlocks huge opportunities, such as it can
answer any question, but also poses threats, such as safety, because there is
no control over the commands that are created. We would like to discuss whether
we can create a new method that improves answers based on dataset/database via
some interpretable ML methods, namely enhanced association rules. The advantage
would be if the method can be also used in some safe technique like RAG.
Association rules have a sound history. Since the introduction of CN2 and
aproiri, many enhancements have been made. In parallel, enhanced association
rules have been introduced and evolved over the last 40 years. The general
problem is typically that there are too many rules. There are some techniques
for handling it, but when LLM emerged, it turned out to be the best use case
for the RAG technique for LLMs. We proposed a method that generates a ruleset
based on defined knowledge patterns, then converts rules into text form via a
rule-to-text converter, and includes the result as an RAG into LLM. We compared
this method with ChatGPT (even with using agents) and we have discovered a
significant improvement in answering questions based on the dataset. We have
also tried several strategies how much rules to generate. We found this
improvement interesting. Moreover, it can also be improved in many ways as
future work, like incorporating other patterns, the use of rule mining as an
agent, and many others.

TL;DR: 研究者开发了一个基于大语言模型的系统，用于从电子健康记录中回答临床问题，通过两步法优化相关句子筛选和答案生成，并发现小模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高从电子健康记录（EHR）中回答临床问题的准确性和效率，优化相关信息的筛选和答案生成过程。

Method: 采用两步法：先用大语言模型筛选与问题相关的句子，再基于这些句子生成简短且有引用的回答；使用少样本提示、自我一致性和阈值化优化句子分类。

Result: 研究发现较小的8B模型在筛选相关信息时表现优于较大的70B模型，且准确的句子筛选对生成高质量回答至关重要，自我一致性与阈值化提高了决策可靠性。

Conclusion: 系统成功结合大语言模型和优化技术，有效提升了从EHR中回答临床问题的能力，小模型的出色表现提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: We describe our system for the ArchEHR-QA Shared Task on answering clinical
questions using electronic health records (EHRs). Our approach uses large
language models in two steps: first, to find sentences in the EHR relevant to a
clinician's question, and second, to generate a short, citation-supported
response based on those sentences. We use few-shot prompting, self-consistency,
and thresholding to improve the sentence classification step to decide which
sentences are essential. We compare several models and find that a smaller 8B
model performs better than a larger 70B model for identifying relevant
information. Our results show that accurate sentence selection is critical for
generating high-quality responses and that self-consistency with thresholding
helps make these decisions more reliable.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SynthesizeMe的方法，通过用户交互生成合成用户角色，用于个性化奖励建模，提升了大型语言模型作为评判者的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前个性化奖励模型过于依赖额外身份信息，为了在没有这些信息的情况下实现个性化，研究提出了利用用户交互生成合成用户角色的方法。

Method: SynthesizeMe通过生成和验证解释用户偏好的推理，从中诱导合成用户角色，并筛选出有信息量的用户交互来构建个性化提示。

Result: 使用SynthesizeMe生成的提示在Chatbot Arena上将个性化LLM作为评判者的准确性提升了4.4%，同时在PersonalRewardBench上取得了最佳表现。

Conclusion: SynthesizeMe方法有效地解决了依赖额外身份信息的问题，显著提升了个性化奖励模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent calls for pluralistic alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs)
encourage adapting models to diverse user preferences. However, most prior work
on personalized reward models heavily rely on additional identity information,
such as demographic details or a predefined set of preference categories. To
this end, we introduce SynthesizeMe, an approach to inducing synthetic user
personas from user interactions for personalized reward modeling. SynthesizeMe
first generates and verifies reasoning to explain user preferences, then
induces synthetic user personas from that reasoning, and finally filters to
informative prior user interactions in order to build personalized prompts for
a particular user. We show that using SynthesizeMe induced prompts improves
personalized LLM-as-a-judge accuracy by 4.4% on Chatbot Arena. Combining
SynthesizeMe derived prompts with a reward model achieves top performance on
PersonalRewardBench: a new curation of user-stratified interactions with
chatbots collected from 854 users of Chatbot Arena and PRISM.

Motivation: 解决缺乏高质量公开数据集的问题，以评估LLMs模拟真实用户行为的能力。

Method: 通过在线问卷和自定义浏览器插件收集用户数据，构建OPERA数据集，并设立基准。

Result: OPERA数据集为LLM预测用户行为和动机提供了首个公开基准。

Conclusion: OPERA为LLM代理的个性化数字孪生研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) accurately simulate the next web action of a
specific user? While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating
``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user
behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality,
publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the
internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce
OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected
from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the
first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser
observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time
rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser
plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the
first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's
next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action,
rationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into
LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.

Motivation: 目前的研究尚未充分探讨患者转录数据中性别因素对痴呆检测模型的影响，因此需要解决性别混淆问题以提升模型的公正性和准确性。

Method: 提出了两种方法：扩展混淆过滤器和双重过滤器，用于隔离和消除与性别相关的权重。

Result: 实验结果表明，虽然去性别混淆会轻微降低痴呆检测性能，但能显著减少模型对训练数据分布的过拟合并提升公正性。

Conclusion: 通过消除性别相关权重，可以实现去混淆的痴呆分类器，为阿尔茨海默病的早期筛查提供了更公正的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep transformer models have been used to detect linguistic anomalies in
patient transcripts for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) screening. While
pre-trained neural language models (LMs) fine-tuned on AD transcripts perform
well, little research has explored the effects of the gender of the speakers
represented by these transcripts. This work addresses gender confounding in
dementia detection and proposes two methods: the $\textit{Extended Confounding
Filter}$ and the $\textit{Dual Filter}$, which isolate and ablate weights
associated with gender. We evaluate these methods on dementia datasets with
first-person narratives from patients with cognitive impairment and healthy
controls. Our results show transformer models tend to overfit to training data
distributions. Disrupting gender-related weights results in a deconfounded
dementia classifier, with the trade-off of slightly reduced dementia detection
performance.

Motivation: 在领域特定任务中，微调大型语言模型通常计算成本高且技术复杂，因此探索参数高效的微调方法是必要的，软提示技术是一种有前景的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种输入依赖的软提示技术（ID-SPAM），利用自注意力机制根据输入令牌动态生成软提示，并分配不同的重要性，仅需训练少量参数。

Result: 在多项任务中优于现有技术，同时展示了更强的零样本领域迁移能力。

Conclusion: ID-SPAM是一种简单高效的参数高效微调方法，能够显著提升模型性能，尤其在零样本迁移任务中表现突出。

Abstract: The performance of large language models in domain-specific tasks
necessitates fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and technically
challenging. This paper focuses on parameter-efficient fine-tuning using soft
prompting, a promising approach that adapts pre-trained models to downstream

Soft Prompting technique with a self-Attention Mechanism (ID-SPAM) that
generates soft prompts based on the input tokens and attends different tokens
with varying importance. Our method is simple and efficient, keeping the number
of trainable parameters small. We show the merits of the proposed approach
compared to state-of-the-art techniques on various tasks and show the improved
zero shot domain transfer capability.

results indicate that general purpose LLMs cannot consistently detect or decode

domain adaptation and specialised prompting techniques. These results provide
important insights to inform the development and deployment of automated
moderation technologies. We further develop and release novel labelled and
unlabelled datasets, including 19.4M posts from extremist platforms and

Result: 合成数据有效区分了不同形式的记忆，但构建真实虚构数据存在挑战。

Conclusion: 新数据集为研究语言模型记忆机制提供了工具，但需进一步优化合成数据的设计。

Abstract: When language models are trained on textual data, they acquire both knowledge
about the structure of language as well as knowledge of facts about the world.
At inference time, their knowledge of facts can be leveraged to solve
interesting problems and perform useful knowledge work for users. It is well
known that language models can verbatim memorize long sequences from their
training data. However, it is much less well understood how language models
memorize facts seen during training. In this work, we propose a new dataset to
specifically empower researchers to study the dual processes of fact
memorization and verbatim sequence memorization. The dataset consists of
synthetically-generated, webtext-like documents about fictional events, as well
as question-answer pairs about the events. We conduct training experiments
showing how synthetic data about fictional events can be effective in teasing
apart different forms of memorization. We also document the challenges in
effectively building realistic, fictional synthetic data.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了CulturalPersonas，首个大规模、经过人类验证的基准，用于评估LLMs在文化背景下的人格表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在交互应用中的普及，如教学和心理健康，表达文化适宜的人格特质变得重要。现有研究忽视了文化与人格的相互作用。

Method: 构建包含3000个情境问题的数据集，涵盖六个国家，通过多选和开放式问答评估3个LLMs。

Result: CulturalPersonas显著提高了LLMs与特定国家人格分布的匹配度（Wasserstein距离减少20%以上），并产生更具文化一致性的输出。

Conclusion: CulturalPersonas通过结合文化与人格表达，为LLMs的全球适应性提供了新方向。

Abstract: As LLMs become central to interactive applications, ranging from tutoring to
mental health, the ability to express personality in culturally appropriate
ways is increasingly important. While recent works have explored personality
evaluation of LLMs, they largely overlook the interplay between culture and
personality. To address this, we introduce CulturalPersonas, the first
large-scale benchmark with human validation for evaluating LLMs' personality
expression in culturally grounded, behaviorally rich contexts. Our dataset
spans 3,000 scenario-based questions across six diverse countries, designed to
elicit personality through everyday scenarios rooted in local values. We
evaluate three LLMs, using both multiple-choice and open-ended response
formats. Our results show that CulturalPersonas improves alignment with
country-specific human personality distributions (over a 20% reduction in
Wasserstein distance across models and countries) and elicits more expressive,
culturally coherent outputs compared to existing benchmarks. CulturalPersonas
surfaces meaningful modulated trait outputs in response to culturally grounded
prompts, offering new directions for aligning LLMs to global norms of behavior.
By bridging personality expression and cultural nuance, we envision that
CulturalPersonas will pave the way for more socially intelligent and globally
adaptive LLMs.

Motivation: 现有ECI模型依赖大规模标注数据，且大型语言模型易产生虚假因果链接。

Method: 任务分解为三个主任务和三个辅助任务，利用设计的提示引导LLM生成确定性和不确定性响应，通过模糊聚合量化证据。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，MEFA在F1分数和精确度上分别超过次优基线6.2%和9.3%，显著减少幻觉错误。

Conclusion: MEFA通过任务分解和模糊聚合有效解决了ECI问题，验证了其方法的优越性。

Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) aims to detect causal relationships
between events in textual contexts. Existing ECI models predominantly rely on
supervised methodologies, suffering from dependence on large-scale annotated
data. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) enable zero-shot ECI, they are
prone to causal hallucination-erroneously establishing spurious causal links.
To address these challenges, we propose MEFA, a novel zero-shot framework based
on Multi-source Evidence Fuzzy Aggregation. First, we decompose causality
reasoning into three main tasks (temporality determination, necessity analysis,
and sufficiency verification) complemented by three auxiliary tasks. Second,
leveraging meticulously designed prompts, we guide LLMs to generate uncertain
responses and deterministic outputs. Finally, we quantify LLM's responses of
sub-tasks and employ fuzzy aggregation to integrate these evidence for
causality scoring and causality determination. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks demonstrate that MEFA outperforms second-best unsupervised baselines
by 6.2% in F1-score and 9.3% in precision, while significantly reducing
hallucination-induced errors. In-depth analysis verify the effectiveness of
task decomposition and the superiority of fuzzy aggregation.

Abstract: This paper advances a unified representation of linguistic structure for
three grammar formalisms, namely, Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG), Dependency
Grammar (DG) and Categorial Grammar (CG) from the perspective of syntactic and
computational complexity considerations. The correspondence principle is
proposed to enable a unified representation of the representational principles
from PSG, DG, and CG. To that end, the paper first illustrates a series of
steps in achieving a unified representation for a discontinuous subordinate
clause from Turkish as an illustrative case. This affords a new way of
approaching discontinuity in natural language from a theoretical point of view
that unites and integrates the basic tenets of PSG, DG, and CG, with
significant consequences for syntactic analysis. Then this paper demonstrates
that a unified representation can simplify computational complexity with
regards to the neurocognitive representation and processing of both continuous
and discontinuous sentences vis-\`a-vis the basic principles of PSG, DG, and
CG.

Conclusion: GraphRAG在某些特定场景下表现更优，研究为其实践应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. It
leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts,
enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate
reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG
frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a
critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do
graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this,
we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual
reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of
increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual
summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the
entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final
generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we systematically investigate the
conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG and the underlying reasons
for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application. All related
resources and analyses are collected for the community at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法在训练大型语言模型时，容易导致学生模型分布偏移、灾难性遗忘等问题。POCL框架旨在通过渐进式训练策略解决这些问题。

Method: POCL框架包括两部分：难度测量器（对训练样本按难度排序）和训练调度器（逐步引入样本并提高损失函数温度）。

Result: 实验证明，POCL在多种KD方法和模型家族中均提升了学生模型的性能。

Conclusion: 通过结构化训练数据，POCL显著提升了知识蒸馏的稳定性和效果。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

### [230] [Large Language Models are Good Relational Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05725)
*Fang Wu,Vijay Prakash Dwivedi,Jure Leskovec*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Rel-LLM提出了一种新架构，结合图神经网络（GNN）和检索增强生成（RAG），有效解决了LLM在处理关系型数据时的结构丢失和冗余问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在关系深度学习（RDL）中的应用仍不足，现有文本序列化方法忽略了关键关系结构并引入冗余。

Method: 通过GNN编码器提取局部子图生成结构化的关系提示，结合RAG框架，保留数据库的关系结构。

Result: 实验表明Rel-LLM在RDL任务中优于现有方法，实现了LLM与结构化数据的高效整合。

Conclusion: Rel-LLM为LLM与结构化数据的结合提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet their application to relational deep learning (RDL)
remains underexplored. Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational
links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into
flat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical
relational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM
context lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a
graph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational
prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework.
Unlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves
the inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to
effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically,
the GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature
representations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal
dependencies. These representations are transformed into structured prompts
using a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over
relational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, offering a scalable and
efficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources. Code is
available at https://github.com/smiles724/Rel-LLM.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个知识遗忘评估框架，用于更准确地评估大型语言模型（LLM）中知识的遗忘情况，克服了现有方法忽略隐式推理依赖和知识非确定性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识遗忘方法主要针对孤立事实的显式移除，忽略了隐式推理依赖和知识的非确定性，导致遗忘效果不准确。

Method: 提出了一种基于知识图谱和置信度分数的评估框架，并开发了一种基于推理的评估协议，利用LLM作为评估者，结合人类评估进行校准。

Result: 实验表明，该框架提供了更现实和严格的遗忘性能评估，并发现当前评估策略倾向于高估遗忘效果。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM中的知识遗忘提供了更可靠的评估方法，揭示了现有评估的局限性，并公开了代码供进一步研究。

Abstract: Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in
large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus
on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential
dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs.
Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through
correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge
unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit
structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as
knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an
inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these
judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning
success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated
against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability.
Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our
framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning
performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies
tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/Graph-COM/Knowledge_Unlearning.git.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了LLMs在时序表格问答中的关键挑战，提升了整体性能。

Abstract: Temporal tabular question answering presents a significant challenge for
Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring robust reasoning over structured data,
which is a task where traditional prompting methods often fall short. These
methods face challenges such as memorization, sensitivity to table size, and
reduced performance on complex queries. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce TempTabQA-C, a synthetic dataset designed for systematic and
controlled evaluations, alongside a symbolic intermediate representation that
transforms tables into database schemas. This structured approach allows LLMs
to generate and execute SQL queries, enhancing generalization and mitigating
biases. By incorporating adaptive few-shot prompting with contextually tailored
examples, our method achieves superior robustness, scalability, and
performance. Experimental results consistently highlight improvements across
key challenges, setting a new benchmark for robust temporal reasoning with
LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Writing-RL的强化学习框架，用于提升大语言模型在长文本写作上的能力，通过自适应课程和动态调整任务难度，显著超越了传统监督微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的监督微调方法在长文本写作任务中存在数据饱和和教师信号限制学习能力的问题，因此需要一种更高效的训练框架。

Method: 框架包含三个关键组件：基于学习潜力选择样本的策略、通过成对比较提供学习信号的奖励机制，以及根据模型性能动态调整任务难度的参考调度方法。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在7B规模的写作模型上显著提升了长文本写作性能，并能很好地泛化到长输入推理任务。

Conclusion: Writing-RL不仅提升了长文本写作能力，还为长上下文训练提供了新的研究视角。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled strong
performance in long-form writing, yet existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
approaches suffer from limitations such as data saturation and restricted
learning capacity bounded by teacher signals. In this work, we present
Writing-RL: an Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework to advance
long-form writing capabilities beyond SFT. The framework consists of three key
components: Margin-aware Data Selection strategy that prioritizes samples with
high learning potential, Pairwise Comparison Reward mechanism that provides
discriminative learning signals in the absence of verifiable rewards, and
Dynamic Reference Scheduling approach, which plays a particularly critical role
by adaptively adjusting task difficulty based on evolving model performance.
Experiments on 7B-scale writer models show that our RL framework largely
improves long-form writing performance over strong SFT baselines. Furthermore,
we observe that models trained with long-output RL generalize surprisingly well
to long-input reasoning tasks, potentially offering a promising perspective for
rethinking long-context training.

TL;DR: BioMol-MQA introduces一个关于多药治疗的多模态QA数据集，包含知识图谱和分子结构，旨在测试LLMs在多模态检索和推理中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG-based LLMs主要检索单模态（如文本），而许多实际问题（如医疗）需要多模态信息（知识图谱、临床文本、分子结构）的检索和合成。

Method: 提出BioMol-MQA数据集，包含多模态知识图谱和设计用于测试LLM在多模态检索和推理能力的复杂问题。

Result: 现有LLMs在未提供背景数据时表现不佳，表明需要更强的RAG框架。

Conclusion: BioMol-MQA数据集为发展多模态RAG框架提供了重要基准，展示了LLMs在多模态检索和推理中的挑战。

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has shown great power in improving Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing RAG-based LLMs are dedicated to
retrieving single modality information, mainly text; while for many real-world
problems, such as healthcare, information relevant to queries can manifest in
various modalities such as knowledge graph, text (clinical notes), and complex
molecular structure. Thus, being able to retrieve relevant multi-modality
domain-specific information, and reason and synthesize diverse knowledge to
generate an accurate response is important. To address the gap, we present
BioMol-MQA, a new question-answering (QA) dataset on polypharmacy, which is
composed of two parts (i) a multimodal knowledge graph (KG) with text and
molecular structure for information retrieval; and (ii) challenging questions
that designed to test LLM capabilities in retrieving and reasoning over
multimodal KG to answer questions. Our benchmarks indicate that existing LLMs
struggle to answer these questions and do well only when given the necessary
background data, signaling the necessity for strong RAG frameworks.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for
scaling language models efficiently by activating only a subset of parameters

model that activates 14B parameters out of a total of 142B parameters,

TL;DR: LLMs具备感知时间流逝的能力，并能调整决策，但该能力因模型大小和推理能力而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs是否感知时间并据此调整决策，填补其时间感知能力的研究空白。

Method: 通过三个实验验证时间感知：Token-Time假设验证、回答长度调整实验、动态环境压力测试。

Result: LLMs能够将离散的token与连续时间关联，但能力受模型和推理能力影响。

Conclusion: 为提升LLMs在时间敏感应用中的表现奠定理论基础。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at temporal reasoning tasks like
event ordering and duration estimation, their ability to perceive the actual
passage of time remains unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs perceive the
passage of time and adapt their decision-making accordingly through three
complementary experiments. First, we introduce the Token-Time Hypothesis,
positing that LLMs can map discrete token counts to continuous wall-clock time,
and validate this through a dialogue duration judgment task. Second, we
demonstrate that LLMs could use this awareness to adapt their response length
while maintaining accuracy when users express urgency in question answering
tasks. Finally, we develop BombRush, an interactive navigation challenge that
examines how LLMs modify behavior under progressive time pressure in dynamic
environments. Our findings indicate that LLMs possess certain awareness of time
passage, enabling them to bridge discrete linguistic tokens and continuous
physical time, though this capability varies with model size and reasoning
abilities. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for enhancing
temporal awareness in LLMs for time-sensitive applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Chain-of-Thought在表格问答中缺乏错误检测和经验复用机制，与人类问题解决方式不符。

Method: MAPLE框架包含Solver（推理）、Checker（验证）、Reflector（错误诊断）和Archiver（长期记忆管理）四个关键组件。

Result: 在WiKiTQ和TabFact数据集上，MAPLE表现优于现有方法，实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: MAPLE通过模仿人类问题解决过程，解决了现有方法的不足，显著提升了表格问答任务的性能。

Abstract: Table-based question answering requires complex reasoning capabilities that
current LLMs struggle to achieve with single-pass inference. Existing
approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought reasoning and question decomposition, lack
error detection mechanisms and discard problem-solving experiences, contrasting
sharply with how humans tackle such problems. In this paper, we propose MAPLE
(Multi-agent Adaptive Planning with Long-term mEmory), a novel framework that
mimics human problem-solving through specialized cognitive agents working in a
feedback-driven loop. MAPLE integrates 4 key components: (1) a Solver using the
ReAct paradigm for reasoning, (2) a Checker for answer verification, (3) a
Reflector for error diagnosis and strategy correction, and (4) an Archiver
managing long-term memory for experience reuse and evolution. Experiments on
WiKiTQ and TabFact demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple LLM backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在金融数值推理任务中存在不足，需提供更准确、全面的评估工具，以提升LRMs的推理能力。

Method: 通过更新和标注问题、构建Python函数、设计难题，并结合推理器与编程器模型，提升LRMs的金融推理性能。

Result: FinanceReasoning显著提升了LRMs的表现（如GPT-4o从83.2%提升至91.6%），但在数值精度上仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估和提升LRMs在领域专用复杂推理任务中的性能奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce FinanceReasoning, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) in financial numerical
reasoning problems. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key advancements. (1) Credibility: We update 15.6% of the questions from four
public datasets, annotating 908 new questions with detailed Python solutions
and rigorously refining evaluation standards. This enables an accurate
assessment of the reasoning improvements of LRMs. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinanceReasoning covers 67.8% of financial concepts and formulas, significantly
surpassing existing datasets. Additionally, we construct 3,133 Python-formatted
functions, which enhances LRMs' financial reasoning capabilities through
refined knowledge (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 91.6% for GPT-4o). (3) Challenge:
Models are required to apply multiple financial formulas for precise numerical
reasoning on 238 Hard problems. The best-performing model (i.e., OpenAI o1 with
PoT) achieves 89.1% accuracy, yet LRMs still face challenges in numerical
precision. We demonstrate that combining Reasoner and Programmer models can
effectively enhance LRMs' performance (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 87.8% for
DeepSeek-R1). Our work paves the way for future research on evaluating and
improving LRMs in domain-specific complex reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 多语言大型推理模型在训练中表现出预训练语言的系统性漂移，导致低资源语言能力快速下降，语言一致性奖励虽能缓解但会牺牲准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究多语言推理模型在训练中语言漂移现象及其机制。

Method: 使用GRPO在中文、韩语和乌克兰语的翻译数据集上微调多语言LRM，监测任务准确性和语言一致性。

Result: (i) GRPO放大语言不平衡；(ii) 语言一致性奖励缓解漂移但降低准确性；(iii) 语言崩溃严重且难以逆转。

Conclusion: 不同语言在推理能力上的训练效果不平等，奖励塑造、数据难度和预训练先验对多语言推理有重要影响。

Abstract: We identify \textbf{Cross-lingual Collapse}, a systematic drift in which the
chain-of-thought (CoT) of a multilingual language model reverts to its dominant
pre-training language even when the prompt is expressed in a different
language. Recent large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved strong logical reasoning performances by
exposing their intermediate reasoning traces, giving rise to large reasoning
models (LRMs). However, the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in LRMs is
not yet fully explored. To investigate the issue, we fine-tune multilingual
LRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of
the GSM$8$K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in three different languages: Chinese,
Korean, and Ukrainian. During training, we monitor both task accuracy and
language consistency of the reasoning chains. Our experiments reveal three key
findings: (i) GRPO rapidly amplifies pre-training language imbalances, leading
to the erosion of low-resource languages within just a few hundred updates;
(ii) language consistency reward mitigates this drift but does so at the
expense of an almost 5 - 10 pp drop in accuracy. and (iii) the resulting
language collapse is severely damaging and largely irreversible, as subsequent
fine-tuning struggles to steer the model back toward its original
target-language reasoning capabilities. Together, these findings point to a
remarkable conclusion: \textit{not all languages are trained equally for
reasoning}. Furthermore, our paper sheds light on the roles of reward shaping,
data difficulty, and pre-training priors in eliciting multilingual reasoning.

Result: 在四个基准测试中，节省了86.85%的API成本，同时保持或超过基线准确率。

Conclusion: R2-Reasoner提供了一种更经济高效的LLM推理方法，框架已开源。

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning has proven essential for enhancing the problem-solving
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into
intermediate steps, either explicitly or implicitly. Extending the reasoning
chain at test time through deeper thought processes or broader exploration, can
furthur improve performance, but often incurs substantial costs due to the
explosion in token usage. Yet, many reasoning steps are relatively simple and
can be handled by more efficient smaller-scale language models (SLMs). This
motivates hybrid approaches that allocate subtasks across models of varying
capacities. However, realizing such collaboration requires accurate task
decomposition and difficulty-aware subtask allocation, which is challenging. To
address this, we propose R2-Reasoner, a novel framework that enables
collaborative reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs by dynamically routing
sub-tasks based on estimated complexity. At the core of our framework is a
Reinforced Model Router, composed of a task decomposer and a subtask allocator.
The task decomposer segments complex input queries into logically ordered
subtasks, while the subtask allocator assigns each subtask to the most
appropriate model, ranging from lightweight SLMs to powerful LLMs, balancing
accuracy and efficiency. To train this router, we introduce a staged pipeline
that combines supervised fine-tuning on task-specific datasets with Group
Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, enabling self-supervised refinement
through iterative reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across four
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that R2-Reasoner reduces API costs by 86.85%
while maintaining or surpassing baseline accuracy. Our framework paves the way
for more cost-effective and adaptive LLM reasoning. The code is open-source at

Method: 开发了MisMitiFact框架，利用轻量级、细粒度的批判模型对LLM输出进行修正，生成基于证据的反驳反馈。

Result: 实验结果证明，MisMitiFact能生成与LLM自反馈质量相当的反驳，同时反馈生成吞吐量提高约5倍。

Conclusion: MisMitiFact是一种高效、可扩展的虚假信息缓解方案，适合大规模应用。

Abstract: Fake news and misinformation poses a significant threat to society, making
efficient mitigation essential. However, manual fact-checking is costly and
lacks scalability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise in automating
counter-response generation to mitigate misinformation, but a critical
challenge lies in their tendency to hallucinate non-factual information.
Existing models mainly rely on LLM self-feedback to reduce hallucination, but
this approach is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose
MisMitiFact, Misinformation Mitigation grounded in Facts, an efficient
framework for generating fact-grounded counter-responses at scale. MisMitiFact
generates simple critique feedback to refine LLM outputs, ensuring responses
are grounded in evidence. We develop lightweight, fine-grained critique models
trained on data sourced from readily available fact-checking sites to identify
and correct errors in key elements such as numerals, entities, and topics in
LLM generations. Experiments show that MisMitiFact generates counter-responses
of comparable quality to LLMs' self-feedback while using significantly smaller
critique models. Importantly, it achieves ~5x increase in feedback generation
throughput, making it highly suitable for cost-effective, large-scale
misinformation mitigation. Code and LLM prompt templates are at

Result: 实验表明异构MoA在性能和参数效率上优于同质MoE-LoRA方法。

Conclusion: MoA通过异构专家整合提升下游任务的知识迁移效果。

Abstract: Recent studies integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) to further enhance the performance of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods in Large Language Model (LLM) applications. Existing methods
employ \emph{homogeneous} MoE-LoRA architectures composed of LoRA experts with
either similar or identical structures and capacities. However, these
approaches often suffer from representation collapse and expert load imbalance,
which negatively impact the potential of LLMs. To address these challenges, we
propose a \emph{heterogeneous} \textbf{Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA)} approach.
This method dynamically integrates PEFT adapter experts with diverse
structures, leveraging their complementary representational capabilities to
foster expert specialization, thereby enhancing the effective transfer of
pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks. MoA supports two variants:
\textbf{(i)} \textit{Soft MoA} achieves fine-grained integration by performing
a weighted fusion of all expert outputs; \textbf{(ii)} \textit{Sparse MoA}
activates adapter experts sparsely based on their contribution, achieving this
with negligible performance degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that
heterogeneous MoA outperforms homogeneous MoE-LoRA methods in both performance
and parameter efficiency. Our project is available at

Result: 在多样化问答任务中，DynamicMind表现出卓越的零样本问答能力，并在性能与计算效率间取得了平衡。

Conclusion: DynamicMind为提升大语言模型的适应性和效率提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) often struggle to dynamically adapt their
reasoning depth to varying task complexities, leading to suboptimal performance
or inefficient resource utilization. To address this, we introduce DynamicMind,
a novel tri-mode thinking system. DynamicMind empowers LLMs to autonomously
select between Fast, Normal, and Slow thinking modes for zero-shot question
answering (ZSQA) tasks through cognitive-inspired prompt engineering. Our
framework's core innovations include: (1) expanding the established
dual-process framework of fast and slow thinking into a tri-mode thinking
system involving a normal thinking mode to preserve the intrinsic capabilities
of LLM; (2) proposing the Thinking Density metric, which aligns computational
resource allocation with problem complexity; and (3) developing the Thinking
Mode Capacity (TMC) dataset and a lightweight Mind Router to predict the
optimal thinking mode. Extensive experiments across diverse mathematical,
commonsense, and scientific QA benchmarks demonstrate that DynamicMind achieves
superior ZSQA capabilities while establishing an effective trade-off between
performance and computational efficiency.

*Xinjie Zhang,Wenxuan Wang,Qin Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了IntentionESC框架和ICECoT机制，旨在提升情感支持对话中意图的理解与策略选择，通过自动标注和实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感支持对话中，意图不明确会导致支持者采用不恰当的策略，因此需要明确意图以指导支持过程和策略选择。

Method: 提出IntentionESC框架定义支持者意图，结合ICECoT机制使LLM模仿人类推理，推断意图并选择策略，通过自动标注生成训练数据。

Result: 开发了全面评估方案并通过实验验证了框架的有效性，数据和代码公开。

Conclusion: IntentionESC和ICECoT提升了情感支持对话的效果，为LLM在情感支持领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: In emotional support conversations, unclear intentions can lead supporters to
employ inappropriate strategies, inadvertently imposing their expectations or
solutions on the seeker. Clearly defined intentions are essential for guiding
both the supporter's motivations and the overall emotional support process. In
this paper, we propose the Intention-centered Emotional Support Conversation
(IntentionESC) framework, which defines the possible intentions of supporters
in emotional support conversations, identifies key emotional state aspects for
inferring these intentions, and maps them to appropriate support strategies.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generating, they fundamentally
operate as probabilistic models trained on extensive datasets, lacking a true
understanding of human thought processes and intentions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Intention Centric Chain-of-Thought (ICECoT)
mechanism. ICECoT enables LLMs to mimic human reasoning by analyzing emotional
states, inferring intentions, and selecting suitable support strategies,
thereby generating more effective emotional support responses. To train the
model with ICECoT and integrate expert knowledge, we design an automated
annotation pipeline that produces high-quality training data. Furthermore, we
develop a comprehensive evaluation scheme to assess emotional support efficacy
and conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework. Our data and code
are available at https://github.com/43zxj/IntentionESC_ICECoT.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的数学应用题（MWP）自动生成系统，无需额外输入，仅需指定数量、年级和题目类型即可生成高质量MWP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学学习对学生来说复杂且考试失败率高，手动创建数学应用题耗时且需要遵守语言规则，现有方法依赖额外输入，本研究旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 开发了一种基于LLM的MWP生成系统，测试了不同LLM、提示策略、多样性增强技术以及人机反馈方法。

Result: 实验证实生成的MWP质量高，拼写和语法问题少，但LLM在满足年级和题目类型要求上仍有困难。

Conclusion: LLM能够高效生成高质量MWP，但需进一步改进以更好地满足特定要求。

Abstract: Mathematics is often perceived as a complex subject by students, leading to
high failure rates in exams. To improve Mathematics skills, it is important to
provide sample questions for students to practice problem-solving. Manually
creating Math Word Problems (MWPs) is time consuming for tutors, because they
have to type in natural language while adhering to grammar and spelling rules
of the language. Existing Deep Learning techniques for MWP generation either
require a tutor to provide the initial portion of the MWP, and/or additional
information such as an equation. In this paper, we present an MWP generation
system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that overcome the need for
additional input - the only input to our system is the number of MWPs needed,
the grade and the type of question (e.g. addition, subtraction). Unlike the
existing LLM-based solutions for MWP generation, we carried out an extensive
set of experiments involving different LLMs, prompting strategies, techniques
to improve the diversity of questions, as well as techniques that employ human
feedback to improve LLM performance. Human and automated evaluations confirmed
that the generated MWPs are high in quality, with minimal spelling and grammar
issues. However, LLMs still struggle to generate questions that adhere to the
specified grade and question type requirements.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的推理时方法Shoes-of-Others（SoO）前缀，通过简单地在LLM输出前添加特定前缀，提升其在对话和叙事场景中的心智理论（ToM）表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心智理论（ToM）推理方法多专注于推断涉及世界状态变化的信念，限制了应用场景。作者希望通过SoO前缀方法，扩展LLM在ToM任务中的适应性和表现。

Method: 提出SoO前缀方法，即在LLM输出前添加“Let's put ourselves in A's shoes.”作为前缀，其中A为目标角色名，以激发模型更忠实的心智推断。

Result: 在无需世界状态变化的两项基准测试中，SoO前缀方法在五种心理状态类别中均显著提升了ToM表现。

Conclusion: SoO前缀方法通过简单改动显著提升了LLM的心智理论能力，显示了其潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Theory of Mind (ToM) in large language models
(LLMs) has not reached human-level performance yet. Since fine-tuning LLMs on
ToM datasets often degrades their generalization, several inference-time
methods have been proposed to enhance ToM in LLMs. However, existing
inference-time methods for ToM are specialized for inferring beliefs from
contexts involving changes in the world state. In this study, we present a new
inference-time method for ToM, Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, which makes
fewer assumptions about contexts and is applicable to broader scenarios. SoO
prefixing simply specifies the beginning of LLM outputs with ``Let's put
ourselves in A's shoes.'', where A denotes the target character's name. We
evaluate SoO prefixing on two benchmarks that assess ToM in conversational and
narrative contexts without changes in the world state and find that it
consistently improves ToM across five categories of mental states. Our analysis
suggests that SoO prefixing elicits faithful thoughts, thereby improving the
ToM performance.

Motivation: 由于现有方法在评估文本匿名化时缺乏通用基准，研究旨在提供一个综合评估工具，以解决隐私保护和信息实用性的矛盾需求。

Method: 研究提出了Tau-Eval，一个开源的Python框架，通过隐私和实用性任务敏感性来评估文本匿名化方法。

Result: Tau-Eval框架提供了代码、文档和教程，便于公开使用和进一步开发。

Conclusion: Tau-Eval为文本匿名化方法的评估提供了一个实用且通用的解决方案，弥补了现有基准的不足。

Abstract: Text anonymization is the process of removing or obfuscating information from
textual data to protect the privacy of individuals. This process inherently
involves a complex trade-off between privacy protection and information
preservation, where stringent anonymization methods can significantly impact
the text's utility for downstream applications. Evaluating the effectiveness of
text anonymization proves challenging from both privacy and utility
perspectives, as there is no universal benchmark that can comprehensively
assess anonymization techniques across diverse, and sometimes contradictory
contexts. We present Tau-Eval, an open-source framework for benchmarking text
anonymization methods through the lens of privacy and utility task sensitivity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型在不同语言和文化背景下的性能差异，尤其是在教育和文化相关领域的应用。

Method: 使用OCR、文本提取和人工验证构建多语言数据集，并比较模型在国际与本土文化问题上的表现。

Result: 模型在国际问题上表现更好（80-95%），而在罗马尼亚本土文化问题上准确率较低（50-75%）。

Conclusion: 文化背景和数据来源显著影响模型表现，研究为构建文化敏感的多语言NLP系统提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate varying performance across languages
and cultural contexts. This study introduces a novel, culturally-rich,
multilingual dataset derived from video recordings of the Romanian game show
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" (Vrei s\u{a} fii Milionar?). We employed an
innovative process combining optical character recognition (OCR), automated
text extraction, and manual verification to collect question-answer pairs,
enriching them with metadata including question domain (e.g., biology,
history), cultural relevance (Romanian-specific vs. international), and
difficulty. Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs, including Romanian-adapted
models, on this dataset revealed significant performance disparities: models
consistently achieve higher accuracy (80-95%) on international questions
compared to Romanian-specific cultural questions (50-75%). We further
investigate these differences through experiments involving machine translation
of Romanian questions into English and cross-lingual tests using a comparable
dataset in French. Our findings underscore the impact of cultural context and
data source on LLM performance and offer practical insights for building
robust, culturally-aware multilingual NLP systems, especially in educational
domains. The dataset is publicly available at Hugging Face.

Motivation: 研究CoT技术在复杂推理任务中效果不一致的机制，探索其与标记概率分布单调性的关联。

Method: 基于标记概率分布设计指标，结合逻辑回归模型开发Dynamic CoT，并推广至闭源模型。

Result: CoT效果评估指标准确率达89.2%，Dynamic CoT减少35%以上标记消耗且保持高准确率。

Conclusion: 为CoT机制提供新视角并建立高效部署框架。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique has proven effective in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks.
However, the performance gains are inconsistent across different tasks, and the
underlying mechanism remains a long-standing research question. In this work,
we make a preliminary observation that the monotonicity of token probability
distributions may be correlated with the gains achieved through CoT reasoning.
Leveraging this insight, we propose two indicators based on the token
probability distribution to assess CoT effectiveness across different tasks. By
combining instance-level indicators with logistic regression model, we
introduce Dynamic CoT, a method that dynamically select between CoT and direct
answer. Furthermore, we extend Dynamic CoT to closed-source models by
transferring decision strategies learned from open-source models. Our
indicators for assessing CoT effectiveness achieve an accuracy of 89.2\%, and
Dynamic CoT reduces token consumption by more than 35\% while maintaining high
accuracy. Overall, our work offers a novel perspective on the underlying
mechanisms of CoT reasoning and provides a framework for its more efficient
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLMs在递归推理能力上存在限制，尤其是在缺乏专家策划数据进行蒸馏的情况下。论文希望通过改进长形式CoT来解决这一问题。

Method: AvR方法通过引入一个结合批评与改进动作的优化过程，利用可微分学习技术优化“改进感知奖励”，生成多轮数据并组织为长改进思维链。

Result: 实验结果显示，AvR显著优于传统的偏好优化方法。仅用3k合成样本，AvR就能将LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct模型在AlpacaEval 2.0上的胜率提升20%以上。

Conclusion: AvR方法成功提升了LLMs的递归推理能力，为未来的研究提供了有效的工具和方向。

Abstract: The OpenAI o1-series models have demonstrated that leveraging long-form Chain
of Thought (CoT) can substantially enhance performance. However, the recursive
thinking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain limited,
particularly in the absence of expert-curated data for distillation. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{AvR}: \textbf{Alignment via Refinement}, a novel
method aimed at unlocking the potential of LLMs for recursive reasoning through
long-form CoT. AvR introduces a refinement process that integrates criticism
and improvement actions, guided by differentiable learning techniques to
optimize \textbf{refinement-aware rewards}. As a result, the synthesized
multi-round data can be organized as a long refinement thought, further
enabling test-time scaling. Experimental results show that AvR significantly
outperforms conventional preference optimization methods. Notably, with only 3k
synthetic samples, our method boosts the performance of the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct
model by over 20\% in win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. Our code is available at

Motivation: 大模型的参数知识与上下文输入常冲突，导致事实不一致或幻觉，需解决方案。

Method: 引入SR-DCR框架，结合令牌级自置信与多代理人辩论，由批评者、辩护者和法官模型协作评估上下文可靠性。

Result: 在ClashEval基准测试中，SR-DCR增强了鲁棒性，优于传统辩论和仅置信度基线。

Conclusion: SR-DCR能有效解决上下文冲突，计算开销小，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models frequently encounter conflicts between their parametric
knowledge and contextual input, often resulting in factual inconsistencies or
hallucinations. We propose Self-Reflective Debate for Contextual Reliability
(SR-DCR), a lightweight framework that integrates token-level self-confidence
with an asymmetric multi-agent debate to adjudicate such conflicts. A critic,
deprived of context, challenges a defender who argues from the given passage; a
judge model evaluates the debate and determines the context's reliability. The
final answer is selected by combining the verdict with model confidence.
Experiments on the ClashEval benchmark demonstrate that SR-DCR consistently
enhances robustness to misleading context while maintaining accuracy on
trustworthy inputs, outperforming both classical debate and confidence-only
baselines with minimal computational overhead. The code is available at
https://github.com/smiles724/Self-Reflective-Debates.

<details>

Motivation: 现有ICL方法因重复检索大规模数据导致高计算成本，需高效替代方案。

Method: 引入'充分性'和'必要性'指标，设计树状算法预选代表性演示子集。

Result: 实验显示FEEDER可减少20%以上训练数据且性能不变。

Conclusion: FEEDER高效且兼容性强，适用于多种ICL下游策略。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) delivers strong
few-shot performance by choosing few-shot demonstrations from the entire
training data. However, existing ICL methods, which rely on similarity or
diversity scores to choose demonstrations, incur high computational costs due
to repeatedly retrieval from large-scale datasets for each query. To this end,
we propose FEEDER (FEw yet Essential Demonstration prE-selectoR), a novel
pre-selection framework that identifies a representative subset of
demonstrations containing the most representative examples in the training
data, tailored to specific LLMs. To construct this subset, we introduce the
"sufficiency" and "necessity" metrics in the pre-selection stage and design a
tree-based algorithm to identify representative examples efficiently. Once
pre-selected, this representative subset can effectively replace the full
training data, improving efficiency while maintaining comparable performance in
ICL. Additionally, our pre-selected subset also benefits fine-tuning LLMs,
where we introduce a bi-level optimization method that enhances training
efficiency without sacrificing performance. Experiments with LLMs ranging from
300M to 8B parameters show that FEEDER can reduce training data size by over
20% while maintaining performance and seamlessly integrating with various
downstream demonstration selection strategies in ICL.

Result: 现有模型只能解决少数问题，表明该基准测试对自动定理证明研究提出了挑战。

Conclusion: MATP-BENCH为多模态自动定理证明研究提供了新的方向，并展示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Numerous theorems, such as those in geometry, are often presented in
multimodal forms (e.g., diagrams). Humans benefit from visual reasoning in such
settings, using diagrams to gain intuition and guide the proof process. Modern
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in solving a wide range of mathematical problems. However, the
potential of MLLMs as Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs), specifically in the
multimodal domain, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the
Multimodal Automated Theorem Proving benchmark (MATP-BENCH), a new Multimodal,
Multi-level, and Multi-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in this
role as multimodal automated theorem provers. MATP-BENCH consists of 1056
multimodal theorems drawn from high school, university, and competition-level
mathematics. All these multimodal problems are accompanied by formalizations in
Lean 4, Coq and Isabelle, thus making the benchmark compatible with a wide
range of theorem-proving frameworks. MATP-BENCH requires models to integrate
sophisticated visual understanding with mastery of a broad spectrum of
mathematical knowledge and rigorous symbolic reasoning to generate formal
proofs. We use MATP-BENCH to evaluate a variety of advanced multimodal language
models. Existing methods can only solve a limited number of the MATP-BENCH
problems, indicating that this benchmark poses an open challenge for research
on automated theorem proving.

Result: 在开源和API-based LLMs上的实验验证了CatShift在无法访问logits时的有效性。

Conclusion: CatShift为保护专有数据提供了实用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
by excelling at interpreting, reasoning about, and generating human language.
However, their reliance on large-scale, often proprietary datasets poses a
critical challenge: unauthorized usage of such data can lead to copyright
infringement and significant financial harm. Existing dataset-inference methods
typically depend on log probabilities to detect suspicious training material,
yet many leading LLMs have begun withholding or obfuscating these signals. This
reality underscores the pressing need for label-only approaches capable of
identifying dataset membership without relying on internal model logits.
  We address this gap by introducing CatShift, a label-only dataset-inference
framework that capitalizes on catastrophic forgetting: the tendency of an LLM
to overwrite previously learned knowledge when exposed to new data. If a
suspicious dataset was previously seen by the model, fine-tuning on a portion
of it triggers a pronounced post-tuning shift in the model's outputs;
conversely, truly novel data elicits more modest changes. By comparing the
model's output shifts for a suspicious dataset against those for a known
non-member validation set, we statistically determine whether the suspicious
set is likely to have been part of the model's original training corpus.
Extensive experiments on both open-source and API-based LLMs validate
CatShift's effectiveness in logit-inaccessible settings, offering a robust and
practical solution for safeguarding proprietary data.

Motivation: 研究FedLLMs在数据隐私保护中的潜在风险，尤其是针对个人身份信息（PII）的提取攻击，以推动更安全的联邦学习防御策略。

Method: 设计针对FedLLMs的提取攻击算法，利用上下文前缀从单个客户端推广到其他客户端，并扩展真实法律数据集以评估攻击效果。

Result: 实验表明，攻击方法能提取高达56.57%的专属PII，其中地址、生日和姓名最易受攻击。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了FedLLMs的隐私风险，提出了新的基准和评估框架，呼吁加强防御策略。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of large language models (FedLLMs) presents a promising
approach for achieving strong model performance while preserving data privacy
in sensitive domains. However, the inherent memorization ability of LLMs makes
them vulnerable to training data extraction attacks. To investigate this risk,
we introduce simple yet effective extraction attack algorithms specifically
designed for FedLLMs. In contrast to prior "verbatim" extraction attacks, which
assume access to fragments from all training data, our approach operates under
a more realistic threat model, where the attacker only has access to a single
client's data and aims to extract previously unseen personally identifiable
information (PII) from other clients. This requires leveraging contextual
prefixes held by the attacker to generalize across clients. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our approaches, we propose two rigorous metrics-coverage rate
and efficiency-and extend a real-world legal dataset with PII annotations
aligned with CPIS, GDPR, and CCPA standards, achieving 89.9% human-verified
precision. Experimental results show that our method can extract up to 56.57%
of victim-exclusive PII, with "Address," "Birthday," and "Name" being the most
vulnerable categories. Our findings underscore the pressing need for robust
defense strategies and contribute a new benchmark and evaluation framework for
future research in privacy-preserving federated learning.

Abstract: Detecting Large Language Model (LLM)-generated code is a growing challenge
with implications for security, intellectual property, and academic integrity.
We investigate the role of conditional probability distributions in improving
zero-shot LLM-generated code detection, when considering both the code and the
corresponding task prompt that generated it. Our key insight is that when
evaluating the probability distribution of code tokens using an LLM, there is
little difference between LLM-generated and human-written code. However,
conditioning on the task reveals notable differences. This contrasts with
natural language text, where differences exist even in the unconditional
distributions. Leveraging this, we propose a novel zero-shot detection approach
that approximates the original task used to generate a given code snippet and
then evaluates token-level entropy under the approximated task conditioning
(ATC). We further provide a mathematical intuition, contextualizing our method
relative to previous approaches. ATC requires neither access to the generator
LLM nor the original task prompts, making it practical for real-world
applications. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves state-of-the-art
results across benchmarks and generalizes across programming languages,
including Python, CPP, and Java. Our findings highlight the importance of
task-level conditioning for LLM-generated code detection. The supplementary
materials and code are available at https://github.com/maorash/ATC, including
the dataset gathering implementation, to foster further research in this area.

### [260] [MIRIAD: Augmenting LLMs with millions of medical query-response pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06091)
*Qinyue Zheng,Salman Abdullah,Sam Rawal,Cyril Zakka,Sophie Ostmeier,Maximilian Purk,Eduardo Reis,Eric J. Topol,Jure Leskovec,Michael Moor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了MIRIAD，一个大规模、经过筛选的医疗QA对数据集，旨在通过结构化医疗知识提升LLMs在医疗领域的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法依赖非结构化医疗文本，存在噪声和难以利用的问题，LLMs在医疗领域的应用缺乏系统化的知识组织方式。

Method: 通过半自动化流程（包括LLM生成、过滤、基础和人工标注）构建MIRIAD数据集，将医疗知识以查询-响应对形式封装。

Result: 实验表明，使用MIRIAD的LLMs在医疗QA任务中准确性提升6.7%，检测医疗幻觉的能力提高22.5-37%。

Conclusion: MIRIAD为医疗领域的LLMs应用提供了更可靠的知识基础，有望推动信息检索、RAG和聊天接口等下游应用。

Abstract: LLMs are bound to transform healthcare with advanced decision support and
flexible chat assistants. However, LLMs are prone to generate inaccurate
medical content. To ground LLMs in high-quality medical knowledge, LLMs have
been equipped with external knowledge via RAG, where unstructured medical
knowledge is split into small text chunks that can be selectively retrieved and
integrated into the LLMs context. Yet, existing RAG pipelines rely on raw,
unstructured medical text, which can be noisy, uncurated and difficult for LLMs
to effectively leverage. Systematic approaches to organize medical knowledge to
best surface it to LLMs are generally lacking. To address these challenges, we
introduce MIRIAD, a large-scale, curated corpus of 5,821,948 medical QA pairs,
each rephrased from and grounded in a passage from peer-reviewed medical
literature using a semi-automated pipeline combining LLM generation, filtering,
grounding, and human annotation. Unlike prior medical corpora, which rely on
unstructured text, MIRIAD encapsulates web-scale medical knowledge in an
operationalized query-response format, which enables more targeted retrieval.
Experiments on challenging medical QA benchmarks show that augmenting LLMs with
MIRIAD improves accuracy up to 6.7% compared to unstructured RAG baselines with
the same source corpus and with the same amount of retrieved text. Moreover,
MIRIAD improved the ability of LLMs to detect medical hallucinations by 22.5 to
37% (increase in F1 score). We further introduce MIRIAD-Atlas, an interactive
map of MIRIAD spanning 56 medical disciplines, enabling clinical users to
visually explore, search, and refine medical knowledge. MIRIAD promises to
unlock a wealth of down-stream applications, including medical information
retrievers, enhanced RAG applications, and knowledge-grounded chat interfaces,
which ultimately enables more reliable LLM applications in healthcare.

*Atharv Kulkarni,Vivek Srikumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了通过强化学习（RL）优化大型语言模型（LLM）生成SQL查询的能力，通过数据库执行的反馈而非传统监督微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否能通过与数据库引擎互动而非监督微调来提升LLM生成SQL查询的能力。

Method: 将问题定义为强化学习任务，利用执行结果作为反馈（奖励或惩罚），并采用GRPO框架进行优化。

Result: RL调优使SQL生成准确率从31.49提升至49.83，错误率从25.43%降至14.71%，接近更大模型SQLCoder-70B的表现。

Conclusion: 执行反馈能有效提升LLM的符号推理能力，为代码生成领域提供新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of code generation with a large language
model (LLM), with a focus on generating SQL queries from natural language
questions. We ask: Instead of using supervised fine tuning with text-code
pairs, can we tune a model by having it interact with a database engine? We
frame this problem as a reinforcement learning problem where the model receives
execution-based feedback from the environment in the form of scalar rewards.
These rewards penalize execution failures and assign positive values when a
query returns a correct answer. We use the rewards within the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework. We use a tabular reasoning benchmark to
test and evaluate our findings. We find that with only weak supervision in the
form of question-answer pairs, RL-tuning improves the accuracy of model
generated SQL code from 31.49 to 49.83 while reducing error percentage from
25.43% to 14.71%. This improvement allowed the model nearly match the
performance performance to the larger SQLCoder-70B model. Our work demonstrates
the potential of using execution-based feedback to improve symbolic reasoning
capabilities of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在NLP分类任务中表现出色，但通常依赖多数投票的聚合标签，可能掩盖标注中的分歧。本研究探讨LLMs能否在主观任务（如仇恨言论检测）中捕获多视角并反映标注者分歧。通过零样本和少样本上下文学习，评估四种开源LLMs，结果显示零样本设置下多视角生成可行，少样本设置则难以完全捕获人类判断。提示设计和样本选择对性能有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs是否能在主观任务中捕获多视角并反映标注者分歧，以解决聚合标签可能掩盖的人类分歧问题。

Method: 使用零样本和少样本上下文学习，评估四种开源LLMs，并采用三种标签建模策略（聚合硬标签、非聚合硬和软标签）。少样本设置中评估基于文本相似性、标注分歧和组合排名的演示选择方法。

Result: 零样本设置下多视角生成可行，少样本设置难以完全捕获人类判断。提示设计和演示选择显著影响性能，而样本顺序影响较小。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs建模主观性存在挑战，需开发更具视角意识和社会智能的模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on NLP
classification tasks. However, they typically rely on aggregated labels-often
via majority voting-which can obscure the human disagreement inherent in
subjective annotations. This study examines whether LLMs can capture multiple
perspectives and reflect annotator disagreement in subjective tasks such as
hate speech and offensive language detection. We use in-context learning (ICL)
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, evaluating four open-source LLMs across
three label modeling strategies: aggregated hard labels, and disaggregated hard
and soft labels. In few-shot prompting, we assess demonstration selection
methods based on textual similarity (BM25, PLM-based), annotation disagreement
(entropy), a combined ranking, and example ordering strategies (random vs.
curriculum-based). Results show that multi-perspective generation is viable in
zero-shot settings, while few-shot setups often fail to capture the full
spectrum of human judgments. Prompt design and demonstration selection notably
affect performance, though example ordering has limited impact. These findings
highlight the challenges of modeling subjectivity with LLMs and the importance
of building more perspective-aware, socially intelligent models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语音搜索和重新评分的语音修正系统，提升了对新电影名称的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于端到端自动语音识别（ASR）模型依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，对新或冷门电影名称的识别效果较差，因此需要一种改进方法。

Method: 通过语音搜索生成ASR模型未考虑的替代方案，再通过重新评分组件选择最终输出。

Result: 在流行电影名称的基准测试中，相对提升4.4%至7.6%的词错误率。

Conclusion: 所提语音修正系统有效提升了ASR模型对新内容的识别能力。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are trained using
paired audio-text samples that are expensive to obtain, since high-quality
ground-truth data requires human annotators. Voice search applications, such as
digital media players, leverage ASR to allow users to search by voice as
opposed to an on-screen keyboard. However, recent or infrequent movie titles
may not be sufficiently represented in the E2E ASR system's training data, and
hence, may suffer poor recognition.
  In this paper, we propose a phonetic correction system that consists of (a) a
phonetic search based on the ASR model's output that generates phonetic
alternatives that may not be considered by the E2E system, and (b) a rescorer
component that combines the ASR model recognition and the phonetic
alternatives, and select a final system output.
  We find that our approach improves word error rate between 4.4 and 7.6%
relative on benchmarks of popular movie titles over a series of competitive
baselines.

Motivation: 探讨NLI模型在条件句中处理预设推理的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出了CONFER数据集，评估了四种NLI模型及大型语言模型在零样本和少样本设置下的表现。

Result: NLI模型在条件句的预设推理中表现不佳，且微调并未提升其性能。

Conclusion: NLI模型在处理复杂预设推理时仍需改进，尤其是条件句中的表现。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining whether a
sentence pair represents entailment, contradiction, or a neutral relationship.
While NLI models perform well on many inference tasks, their ability to handle
fine-grained pragmatic inferences, particularly presupposition in conditionals,
remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce CONFER, a novel dataset
designed to evaluate how NLI models process inference in conditional sentences.
We assess the performance of four NLI models, including two pre-trained models,
to examine their generalization to conditional reasoning. Additionally, we
evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, LLaMA, Gemma, and
DeepSeek-R1, in zero-shot and few-shot prompting settings to analyze their
ability to infer presuppositions with and without prior context. Our findings
indicate that NLI models struggle with presuppositional reasoning in
conditionals, and fine-tuning on existing NLI datasets does not necessarily
improve their performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型中上下文词嵌入如何影响语义解释，特别是双宾语结构的选择对语义的影响。

Method: 使用semantic-features库，构建了一个包含450对句子的数据集，测试两种双宾语结构中‘London’的语义解释差异。

Result: 实验表明，三种掩码语言模型的上下文词嵌入显示出预期的敏感性，验证了工具的有用性。

Conclusion: semantic-features库在研究上下文词嵌入对语义解释的影响方面具有潜力。

Abstract: We introduce semantic-features, an extensible, easy-to-use library based on
Chronis et al. (2023) for studying contextualized word embeddings of LMs by
projecting them into interpretable spaces. We apply this tool in an experiment
where we measure the contextual effect of the choice of dative construction
(prepositional or double object) on the semantic interpretation of utterances
(Bresnan, 2007). Specifically, we test whether "London" in "I sent London the
letter." is more likely to be interpreted as an animate referent (e.g., as the
name of a person) than in "I sent the letter to London." To this end, we devise
a dataset of 450 sentence pairs, one in each dative construction, with
recipients being ambiguous with respect to person-hood vs. place-hood. By
applying semantic-features, we show that the contextualized word embeddings of
three masked language models show the expected sensitivities. This leaves us
optimistic about the usefulness of our tool.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型在生成可执行图表代码时的高错误率问题，探索错误源头并提出解决方案。

Method: 采用多智能体管道，包括起草、执行、修复和判断步骤，使用现成的GPT-4o-mini模型。

Result: 在两个基准测试中错误率降至约4.5%，但发现存在幻觉和可访问性问题。

Conclusion: 未来工作应转向提升图表美学、语义保真度和可访问性，而非仅关注执行可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models can translate natural-language chart descriptions into
runnable code, yet approximately 15\% of the generated scripts still fail to
execute, even after supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We
investigate whether this persistent error rate stems from model limitations or
from reliance on a single-prompt design. To explore this, we propose a
lightweight multi-agent pipeline that separates drafting, execution, repair,
and judgment, using only an off-the-shelf GPT-4o-mini model. On the
\textsc{Text2Chart31} benchmark, our system reduces execution errors to 4.5\%
within three repair iterations, outperforming the strongest fine-tuned baseline
by nearly 5 percentage points while requiring significantly less compute.
Similar performance is observed on the \textsc{ChartX} benchmark, with an error
rate of 4.6\%, demonstrating strong generalization. Under current benchmarks,
execution success appears largely solved. However, manual review reveals that 6
out of 100 sampled charts contain hallucinations, and an LLM-based
accessibility audit shows that only 33.3\% (\textsc{Text2Chart31}) and 7.2\%
(\textsc{ChartX}) of generated charts satisfy basic colorblindness guidelines.
These findings suggest that future work should shift focus from execution
reliability toward improving chart aesthetics, semantic fidelity, and
accessibility.

Method: 通过微调Llama3模型，设计VP评估标准并应用CoT技术，构建对抗测试数据集，比较不同输入方式的性能差异。

Result: 微调后的Llama3-8B模型在VP检测任务中表现最佳，与GPT-4的水平相当，且提示中加入专家知识比单独使用CoT技术更有效。

Conclusion: 研究证实，在小语言模型中融入专家知识可以显著提升VP检测性能，为相关领域提供了实用的技术方案。

Abstract: We develop a voice phishing (VP) detector by fine-tuning Llama3, a
representative open-source, small language model (LM). In the prompt, we
provide carefully-designed VP evaluation criteria and apply the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. To evaluate the robustness of LMs and
highlight differences in their performance, we construct an adversarial test
dataset that places the models under challenging conditions. Moreover, to
address the lack of VP transcripts, we create transcripts by referencing
existing or new types of VP techniques. We compare cases where evaluation
criteria are included, the CoT technique is applied, or both are used together.
In the experiment, our results show that the Llama3-8B model, fine-tuned with a
dataset that includes a prompt with VP evaluation criteria, yields the best
performance among small LMs and is comparable to that of a GPT-4-based VP
detector. These findings indicate that incorporating human expert knowledge
into the prompt is more effective than using the CoT technique for small LMs in
VP detection.

Result: 当前最优模型在最终答案准确率上仅为1-2%，精细调优推理链可显著提升性能。

Conclusion: PuzzleWorld揭示了模型在开放推理中的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Puzzlehunts are a genre of complex, multi-step puzzles lacking well-defined
problem definitions. In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks
consisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to
discover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and
iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,
exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent
progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings
remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a
large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess
step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is
annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive
skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic
analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,
with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise
accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that
fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from
4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near
zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,
are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack
sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release
PuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on
building more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems.

Result: 在EDOS数据集上，二元分类（任务A）和细粒度分类（任务C）的宏观F1分数分别提高了1.5和4.1分。

Conclusion: 通过数据增强和集成策略，显著提升了在线性别歧视检测的性能，解决了数据稀疏和语言微妙性问题。

Abstract: The detection of sexism in online content remains an open problem, as harmful
language disproportionately affects women and marginalized groups. While
automated systems for sexism detection have been developed, they still face two
key challenges: data sparsity and the nuanced nature of sexist language. Even
in large, well-curated datasets like the Explainable Detection of Online Sexism
(EDOS), severe class imbalance hinders model generalization. Additionally, the
overlapping and ambiguous boundaries of fine-grained categories introduce
substantial annotator disagreement, reflecting the difficulty of interpreting
nuanced expressions of sexism. To address these challenges, we propose two
prompt-based data augmentation techniques: Definition-based Data Augmentation
(DDA), which leverages category-specific definitions to generate
semantically-aligned synthetic examples, and Contextual Semantic Expansion
(CSE), which targets systematic model errors by enriching examples with
task-specific semantic features. To further improve reliability in fine-grained
classification, we introduce an ensemble strategy that resolves prediction ties
by aggregating complementary perspectives from multiple language models. Our
experimental evaluation on the EDOS dataset demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance across all tasks, with notable improvements of macro F1 by 1.5
points for binary classification (Task A) and 4.1 points for fine-grained
classification (Task C).

Motivation: 传统RAG方法在外部知识与LLMs内部知识冲突时性能下降，缺乏解决冲突的机制。

Method: 提出DSSP-RAG框架，采用混合注意力区分共享与私有语义，结合认知不确定性检测和能量商降噪。

Result: 实验表明DSSP-RAG能有效解决冲突并提升双流知识的互补性，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DSSP-RAG通过创新机制提升了RAG的性能与稳定性，解决了知识冲突问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a cost-effective approach to mitigate
the hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating the
retrieved external knowledge into the generation process. However, external
knowledge may conflict with the parametric knowledge of LLMs. Furthermore,
current LLMs lack inherent mechanisms for resolving such knowledge conflicts,
making traditional RAG methods suffer from degraded performance and stability.
Thus, we propose a Dual-Stream Knowledge-Augmented Framework for Shared-Private
Semantic Synergy (DSSP-RAG). Central to the framework is a novel approach that
refines self-attention into a mixed-attention, distinguishing shared and
private semantics for a controlled internal-external knowledge integration. To
effectively facilitate DSSP in RAG, we further introduce an unsupervised
hallucination detection method based on cognitive uncertainty, ensuring the
necessity of introducing knowledge, and an Energy Quotient (EQ) based on
attention difference matrices to reduce noise in the retrieved external
knowledge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that DSSP-RAG can
effectively resolve conflicts and enhance the complementarity of dual-stream
knowledge, leading to superior performance over strong baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Cartridge的离线训练小型KV缓存方法，替代传统的基于大规模上下文窗口的ICL方法，以降低推理时的内存和计算成本。通过自我学习（self-study）训练方法，Cartridge能够高效地模拟ICL功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大规模上下文窗口ICL方法在推理时内存消耗高且成本昂贵，因此需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出了Cartridge方法，通过离线训练小型KV缓存，并结合自我学习（self-study）的训练配方，生成合成语料库对话并使用上下文蒸馏目标进行训练。

Result: Cartridge在保持与ICL相近性能的同时，显著降低了内存使用（38.6倍）并提高了吞吐量（26.4倍），同时扩展了有效上下文长度。

Conclusion: Cartridge是一种高效的替代方案，能够在低成本下实现与ICL相似的功能，并具备不需要重新训练即可组合的优点。

Abstract: Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text
corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the
entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL).
Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is
costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with
input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on
each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a
Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge
can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However,
we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token
prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose
self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations
about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.
We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of
ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context
benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while
using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also
extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on
MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference
time without retraining.

### [274] [AdvSumm: Adversarial Training for Bias Mitigation in Text Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06273)
*Mukur Gupta,Nikhil Reddy Varimalla,Nicholas Deas,Melanie Subbiah,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdvSumm是一种针对文本摘要任务的对抗训练框架，旨在通过梯度引导的嵌入扰动提升模型对输入变化的鲁棒性，从而减少摘要中的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在文本摘要任务中表现出色，但其预训练数据中的关联性和框架偏见可能导致下游任务的输出不公平或不恰当。为了解决这一问题，AdvSumm框架被提出。

Method: AdvSumm框架引入了一个Perturber组件，通过梯度引导的扰动作用在序列到序列模型的嵌入层，增强模型对输入变化的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，AdvSumm能够有效减少摘要中的偏见（如姓名-国籍偏见和政治框架偏见），同时保持摘要质量。与标准Transformer和回译等数据增强技术相比，AdvSumm在多个基准数据集上表现出更强的偏见缓解能力。

Conclusion: AdvSumm通过对抗训练方法显著减少了文本摘要中的偏见，且不影响摘要质量，为偏见缓解提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications.
However, these systems often inherit associative and framing biases from
pre-training data, leading to inappropriate or unfair outputs in downstream
tasks. In this work, we present AdvSumm (Adversarial Summarization), a
domain-agnostic training framework designed to mitigate bias in text
summarization through improved generalization. Inspired by adversarial
robustness, AdvSumm introduces a novel Perturber component that applies
gradient-guided perturbations at the embedding level of Sequence-to-Sequence
models, enhancing the model's robustness to input variations. We empirically
demonstrate that AdvSumm effectively reduces different types of bias in
summarization-specifically, name-nationality bias and political framing
bias-without compromising summarization quality. Compared to standard
transformers and data augmentation techniques like back-translation, AdvSumm
achieves stronger bias mitigation performance across benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SNNs在图像分类和物体检测等任务中表现不如ANNs的问题，通过提高信息表达能力来缩小性能差距。

Method: 采用整数二进制泄漏积分-发放（支持整数激活和二进制转换）和范围对齐策略（解决高整数激活问题）。

Result: 在ImageNet上达到74.19%准确率，在COCO上分别提升3.45%和1.6%的mAP@50和mAP@50:95，能耗效率提升6.3倍。

Conclusion: 新型SNNs在性能上匹配或超越ANNs，同时保持了更高的能效，展示了SNNs在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are noted for their brain-like computation and
energy efficiency, but their performance lags behind Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) in tasks like image classification and object detection due to the
limited representational capacity. To address this, we propose a novel spiking
neuron, Integer Binary-Range Alignment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire to
exponentially expand the information expression capacity of spiking neurons
with only a slight energy increase. This is achieved through Integer Binary
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire and range alignment strategy. The Integer Binary Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire allows integer value activation during training and
maintains spike-driven dynamics with binary conversion expands virtual
timesteps during inference. The range alignment strategy is designed to solve
the spike activation limitation problem where neurons fail to activate high
integer values. Experiments show our method outperforms previous SNNs,
achieving 74.19% accuracy on ImageNet and 66.2% mAP@50 and 49.1% mAP@50:95 on
COCO, surpassing previous bests with the same architecture by +3.45% and +1.6%

with the same architecture, and the energy efficiency is improved by
6.3${\times}$.

Motivation: 现有记忆电阻储备计算系统的性能高度依赖输入预处理方法和储备池大小，但缺乏对这些因素影响的全面评估。

Method: 论文比较了多种预处理方法，并提出了一种新的奇偶性预处理方法，以评估其对准确性和能耗的影响。

Result: 提出的奇偶性预处理方法将准确性提高了2-6%，同时设备数量仅适度增加。

Conclusion: 研究强调了预处理策略对记忆电阻RC系统效率和可扩展性的重要性。

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) has attracted attention as an efficient recurrent
neural network architecture due to its simplified training, requiring only its
last perceptron readout layer to be trained. When implemented with memristors,
RC systems benefit from their dynamic properties, which make them ideal for
reservoir construction. However, achieving high performance in memristor-based
RC remains challenging, as it critically depends on the input preprocessing
method and reservoir size. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive evaluation
that quantifies the impact of these factors is still lacking. This paper
systematically compares various preprocessing methods for memristive RC
systems, assessing their effects on accuracy and energy consumption. We also
propose a parity-based preprocessing method that improves accuracy by 2-6%
while requiring only a modest increase in device count compared to other
methods. Our findings highlight the importance of informed preprocessing
strategies to improve the efficiency and scalability of memristive RC systems.

Motivation: 研究动机是探讨AI推理能力的提升是否也能改善知识传输，即模型能否以人类可理解、应用和学习的方式传递推理。

Method: 方法包括引入KITE框架，开展两阶段实验：人类与AI共同制定问题解决策略，然后独立实施解决方案，以衡量模型解释对人类理解的影响。

Result: 结果显示，模型基准性能与协作结果相关，但关系不稳定，存在显著异常值，表明知识传输需要专门优化。

Conclusion: 结论是知识传输需要特定优化，并提出了行为与战略因素对成功知识传输的中介作用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI reasoning have driven substantial improvements
across diverse tasks. A critical open question is whether these improvements
also yields better knowledge transfer: the ability of models to communicate
reasoning in ways humans can understand, apply, and learn from. To investigate
this, we introduce Knowledge Integration and Transfer Evaluation (KITE), a
conceptual and experimental framework for Human-AI knowledge transfer
capabilities and conduct the first large-scale human study (N=118) explicitly
designed to measure it. In our two-phase setup, humans first ideate with an AI
on problem-solving strategies, then independently implement solutions,
isolating model explanations' influence on human understanding. Our findings
reveal that although model benchmark performance correlates with collaborative
outcomes, this relationship is notably inconsistent, featuring significant
outliers, indicating that knowledge transfer requires dedicated optimization.
Our analysis identifies behavioral and strategic factors mediating successful
knowledge transfer. We release our code, dataset, and evaluation framework to
support future work on communicatively aligned models.

TL;DR: MMTU是一个大规模基准测试，涵盖25个真实世界表格任务，旨在全面评估模型在处理专家级表格任务中的能力，显示当前前沿模型仍有显著改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs在表格处理方面取得进展，但现有评估主要集中在NL-to-SQL等狭窄任务，缺乏对专业用户复杂任务的全面评测，这种空白限制了模型的进步。

Method: MMTU包含30K+问题，覆盖25个真实世界表格任务，结合了表格理解、推理和编程技能，任务来源于数十年计算机科学研究。

Result: 前沿模型如OpenAI o4-mini和DeepSeek R1在MMTU测试中仅得分约60%，表明仍需大幅改进。

Conclusion: MMTU填补了表格任务评估的空白，希望推动结构化数据处理基础模型的进一步发展。

Abstract: Tables and table-based use cases play a crucial role in many important
real-world applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and computational
notebooks, which traditionally require expert-level users like data engineers,
data analysts, and database administrators to operate. Although LLMs have shown
remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database
copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains
limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks,
evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like
NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks
that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model
progress in this important area.
  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K
questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively
evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at
the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science
research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by
professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills --
including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging
for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI
o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, suggesting significant room for
improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope

Motivation: 为解决现有约束解码方法扭曲模型分布的问题，尤其是在程序模糊测试等需要多样且有效样本的应用中。

Method: 基于MCMC构建提案分布，并结合Metropolis-Hastings接受准则，确保高效探索约束空间。

Result: 在合成基准和真实程序模糊测试任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在满足约束的同时，高效且准确地收敛到真实条件分布。

Abstract: Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that
provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding
approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that
is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants
to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a
new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying
(every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling
process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient
(high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal
distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance
criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient
exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms
existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing
tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents have recently emerged as advanced
paradigms that exhibit impressive capabilities in a wide range of domains and

one-size-fits-all approach, lacking the flexibility to respond to users'

PersonaAgent, the first personalized LLM agent framework designed to address
versatile personalization tasks. Specifically, PersonaAgent integrates two
complementary components - a personalized memory module that includes episodic
and semantic memory mechanisms; a personalized action module that enables the
agent to perform tool actions tailored to the user. At the core, the persona
(defined as unique system prompt for each user) functions as an intermediary:
it leverages insights from personalized memory to control agent actions, while
the outcomes of these actions in turn refine the memory. Based on the
framework, we propose a test-time user-preference alignment strategy that
simulate the latest n interactions to optimize the persona prompt, ensuring
real-time user preference alignment through textual loss feedback between
simulated and ground-truth responses. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that
PersonaAgent significantly outperforms other baseline methods by not only
personalizing the action space effectively but also scaling during test-time
real-world applications. These results underscore the feasibility and potential
of our approach in delivering tailored, dynamic user experiences.

implemented in various organizational settings. Despite significant advances in
memory components such as RAG, vector stores, and LLM agents, these systems
still have substantial memory limitations. Gen AI workflows rarely store or
reflect on the full context in which decisions are made. This leads to repeated
errors and a general lack of clarity. This paper introduces Contextual Memory
Intelligence (CMI) as a new foundational paradigm for building intelligent
systems. It repositions memory as an adaptive infrastructure necessary for
longitudinal coherence, explainability, and responsible decision-making rather
than passive data. Drawing on cognitive science, organizational theory,
human-computer interaction, and AI governance, CMI formalizes the structured
capture, inference, and regeneration of context as a fundamental system
capability. The Insight Layer is presented in this paper to operationalize this
vision. This modular architecture uses human-in-the-loop reflection, drift
detection, and rationale preservation to incorporate contextual memory into
systems. The paper argues that CMI allows systems to reason with data, history,
judgment, and changing context, thereby addressing a foundational blind spot in
current AI architectures and governance efforts. A framework for creating
intelligent systems that are effective, reflective, auditable, and socially
responsible is presented through CMI. This enhances human-AI collaboration,
generative AI design, and the resilience of the institutions.

### [289] [Low-Resource Domain Adaptation for Speech LLMs via Text-Only Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05671)
*Yangui Fang,Jing Peng,Xu Li,Yu Xi,Chengwei Zhang,Guohui Zhong,Kai Yu*

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅使用无配对目标域文本的文本微调策略，用于低资源设置的语音LLM领域适应，无需额外音频数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音LLM在低资源环境下对新领域的适应能力有限，缺乏配对的语音-文本数据。

Method: 采用文本微调策略，引入实时评估机制以保持语音-文本对齐，无需额外音频数据。

Result: 实验显示，方法在LibriSpeech、SlideSpeech和Medical数据集上表现优异，性能接近完整音频-文本微调。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了低资源领域适应问题，避免了灾难性遗忘，展示了文本微调的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) have combined speech
encoders with large language models (LLMs) through projection, forming Speech
LLMs with strong performance. However, adapting them to new domains remains
challenging, especially in low-resource settings where paired speech-text data
is scarce. We propose a text-only fine-tuning strategy for Speech LLMs using
unpaired target-domain text without requiring additional audio. To preserve
speech-text alignment, we introduce a real-time evaluation mechanism during
fine-tuning. This enables effective domain adaptation while maintaining
source-domain performance. Experiments on LibriSpeech, SlideSpeech, and Medical
datasets show that our method achieves competitive recognition performance,
with minimal degradation compared to full audio-text fine-tuning. It also
improves generalization to new domains without catastrophic forgetting,
highlighting the potential of text-only fine-tuning for low-resource domain
adaptation of ASR.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ALLMs能否作为自动评估者，评估SLMs生成的演讲风格，包括情感、音量等非文本元素。

Method: 使用ALLM（GPT-4o和Gemini）和人类评估四种SLM在语音风格任务中的表现。

Result: Gemini与人类评估者的一致性较高，表明ALLMs可作为评估工具，但SLM风格控制仍需优化。

Conclusion: ALLMs是有效的评估工具，但SLM在生成自然对话和控制风格方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) can understand the textual and
non-textual information in the audio input. In this paper, we explore using
ALLMs as an automatic judge to assess the speaking styles of speeches. We use
ALLM judges to evaluate the speeches generated by SLMs on two tasks: voice
style instruction following and role-playing. The speaking style we consider
includes emotion, volume, speaking pace, word emphasis, pitch control, and
non-verbal elements. We use four spoken language models (SLMs) to complete the
two tasks and use humans and ALLMs to judge the SLMs' responses. We compare two
ALLM judges, GPT-4o-audio and Gemini-2.5-pro, with human evaluation results and
show that the agreement between Gemini and human judges is comparable to the
agreement between human evaluators. These promising results show that ALLMs can
be used as a judge to evaluate SLMs. Our results also reveal that current SLMs,
even GPT-4o-audio, still have room for improvement in controlling the speaking
style and generating natural dialogues.

Motivation: 由于语音情感识别系统中存在说话者特征与情绪标签的虚假相关性，导致跨人口群体的预测不公平，现有去偏方法要么需要修改模型，要么依赖人口统计信息，限制了实用性。

Method: CO-VADA通过识别反映数据偏见模式的训练样本，应用声音转换技术改变无关属性，生成多样化样本，引导模型关注情绪相关特征。

Result: 该方法兼容多种语音情感识别模型和声音转换工具，是一个可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Conclusion: CO-VADA有效提升语音情感识别系统的公平性，无需模型修改或人口统计信息。

Abstract: Bias in speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often stems from spurious
correlations between speaker characteristics and emotional labels, leading to
unfair predictions across demographic groups. Many existing debiasing methods
require model-specific changes or demographic annotations, limiting their
practical use. We present CO-VADA, a Confidence-Oriented Voice Augmentation
Debiasing Approach that mitigates bias without modifying model architecture or
relying on demographic information. CO-VADA identifies training samples that
reflect bias patterns present in the training data and then applies voice
conversion to alter irrelevant attributes and generate samples. These augmented
samples introduce speaker variations that differ from dominant patterns in the
data, guiding the model to focus more on emotion-relevant features. Our
framework is compatible with various SER models and voice conversion tools,
making it a scalable and practical solution for improving fairness in SER
systems.

*Souradip Nath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-4V在未经特定任务微调的情况下，通过不同提示策略在图像拼接检测任务中表现出竞争力，尤其在零样本和思维链提示下效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索GPT-4V在多模态任务中的现成能力，特别关注图像伪造检测领域的应用。

Method: 使用三种提示策略（零样本、少量样本、思维链）在CASIA v2.0数据集上评估GPT-4V的性能。

Result: GPT-4V在零样本设置下准确率超过85%，思维链提示表现最均衡，且模型能结合低级视觉特征和上下文知识进行判断。

Conclusion: 尽管不及专用模型，GPT-4V的泛化性、可解释性和百科知识推理能力表明其在图像取证领域有潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V are capable of reasoning
across text and image modalities, showing promise in a variety of complex
vision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the
out-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics,
specifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any
task-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies:
Zero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a
curated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.
  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in
zero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the
most balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative
analysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual
artifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object
scale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible
composites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing
detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic
reasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics.

TL;DR: CarboNeXT是一个用于光学气体成像(OGI)的语义分割框架，用于检测和量化CO$_2$排放，在畜牧业中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CO$_2$排放是环境与工业过程中的关键指标，畜牧业也需要高效监测工具。

Method: 结合多尺度上下文聚合网络与UPerHead和辅助FCN组件，同时提出两个新数据集CCR和RTA。

Result: 在CCR和RTA数据集上分别达到88.46%和92.95%的mIoU，实时性能达60.95 FPS。

Conclusion: CarboNeXT及轻量版CarboFormer为CO$_2$排放分析提供高效工具，尤其适用于畜牧业。

Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions are critical indicators of both
environmental impact and various industrial processes, including livestock
management. We introduce CarboNeXT, a semantic segmentation framework for
Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions
across diverse applications. Our approach integrates a multi-scale context
aggregation network with UPerHead and auxiliary FCN components to effectively
model both local details and global relationships in gas plume imagery. We
contribute two novel datasets: (1) the Controlled Carbon Dioxide Release (CCR)
dataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates
(10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions
from dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CarboNeXT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
88.46% mIoU on CCR and 92.95% mIoU on RTA, with particular effectiveness in
challenging low-flow scenarios. The model operates at 60.95 FPS, enabling
real-time monitoring applications. Additionally, we propose CarboFormer, a
lightweight variant with only 5.07M parameters that achieves 84.68 FPS, with
competitive performance of 84.88% mIoU on CCR and 92.98% on RTA, making it
suitable for resource-constrained platforms such as programmable drones. Our
work advances both environmental sensing and precision livestock management by
providing robust tools for CO$_2$ emission analysis, with a specific focus on
livestock applications.

TL;DR: STFlow是一种生成模型，通过建模整个切片的基因表达联合分布来考虑细胞间相互作用，解决了现有方法的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学（ST）因其结合组织学成像和基因表达分析而强大，但低通量和特殊实验设施限制了其应用。现有预测方法未能充分建模细胞间相互作用且面临内存限制问题。

Method: STFlow采用流匹配生成模型，建模整个切片基因表达的联合分布，并利用高效的切片级编码器和局部空间注意力机制，避免了内存开销过大的问题。

Result: 在HEST-1k和STImage-1K4M基准测试中，STFlow显著优于现有基线方法，相对病理学基础模型提升了超过18%。

Conclusion: STFlow通过改进的建模方法和高效架构，在空间转录组学数据预测中表现出色，解决了现有技术的不足。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as a powerful technology for
bridging histology imaging with gene expression profiling. However, its
application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized
experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide
histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major
limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they
factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene
expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with
memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in
typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative
model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution
of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level
encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without
excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M
benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.

TL;DR: 提出一种种子选择方法，通过从多个候选种子中选出最佳种子来提高图像质量，且不增加比特率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的可扩展图像编码方法需要额外传输信息以实现可扩展性，而现有扩散方法虽不需额外比特率，但使用单一随机种子可能导致图像质量不理想。

Method: 从多个候选种子中选择最佳种子，基于逆向扩散过程的早期中间输出来降低计算成本。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的种子选择方法能有效提升图像质量而不增加比特率。

Abstract: Conventional methods for scalable image coding for humans and machines
require the transmission of additional information to achieve scalability. A
recent diffusion-based method avoids this by generating human-oriented images
from machine-oriented images without extra bitrate. This method, however, uses
a single random seed, which may lead to suboptimal image quality. In this
paper, we propose a seed selection method that identifies the optimal seed from
multiple candidates to improve image quality without increasing the bitrate. To
reduce computational cost, the selection is performed based on intermediate
outputs obtained from early steps of the reverse diffusion process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
across multiple metrics.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样化场景中生成高质量立体图像，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了生成立体图像的挑战，展示了在质量和一致性上的优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based approach to generate stereo
images given a text prompt. Since stereo image datasets with large baselines
are scarce, training a diffusion model from scratch is not feasible. Therefore,
we propose leveraging the strong priors learned by Stable Diffusion and
fine-tuning it on stereo image datasets to adapt it to the task of stereo
generation. To improve stereo consistency and text-to-image alignment, we
further tune the model using prompt alignment and our proposed stereo
consistency reward functions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our approach in generating high-quality stereo images across
diverse scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have opened the door to new research
perspectives in the domain of art and cultural heritage, where a large number
of artifacts have been digitized. There is a need for innovation to ease the
access and highlight the content of digital collections. Such innovations
develop into creative explorations of the digital image in relation to its
malleability and contemporary interpretation, in confrontation to the original
historical object. Based on the concept of the autonomous image, we propose a
new framework towards the production of self-explaining cultural artifacts
using open-source large-language, face detection, text-to-speech and
audio-to-animation models. The goal is to start from a digitized artwork and to
automatically assemble a short video of the latter where the main character
animates to explain its content. The whole process questions cultural biases
encapsulated in large-language models, the potential of digital images and
deepfakes of artworks for educational purposes, along with concerns of the
field of art history regarding such creative diversions.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation is critical for optimal policy design in dynamic
systems. However, obtaining true system states is often impractical or
infeasible, complicating the policy learning process. This paper introduces a
novel neural architecture that integrates spatial feature extraction using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and temporal modeling through gated
recurrent units (GRUs), enabling effective state representation from sequences
of images and corresponding actions. These learned state representations are
used to train a reinforcement learning agent with a Deep Q-Network (DQN).
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach enables real-time,
accurate estimation and control without direct access to ground-truth states.
Additionally, we provide a quantitative evaluation methodology for assessing
the accuracy of the learned states, highlighting their impact on policy
performance and control stability.

Abstract: Rapid spread of false images and videos on online platforms is an emerging
problem. Anyone may add, delete, clone or modify people and entities from an
image using various editing software which are readily available. This
generates false and misleading proof to hide the crime. Now-a-days, these false
and counterfeit images and videos are flooding on the internet. These spread
false information. Many methods are available in literature for detecting those
counterfeit contents but new methods of counterfeiting are also evolving.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are observed to be one effective method
as it modifies the context and definition of images producing plausible results
via image-to-image translation. This work uses an independent discriminant
network that can identify GAN generated image or video. A discriminant network
has been created using a convolutional neural network based on
InceptionResNetV2. The article also proposes a platform where users can detect
forged images and videos. This proposed work has the potential to help the
forensics domain to detect counterfeit videos and hidden criminal evidence
towards the identification of criminal activities.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are one of the most revolutionary inventions
of 21st century. At the core of a UAV lies the central processing system that
uses wireless signals to control their movement. The most popular UAVs are
quadcopters that use a set of four motors, arranged as two on either side with
opposite spin. An autonomous UAV is called a drone. Drones have been in service
in the US army since the 90's for covert missions critical to national
security. It would not be wrong to claim that drones make up an integral part
of the national security and provide the most valuable service during
surveillance operations. While UAVs are controlled using wireless signals,
there reside some challenges that disrupt the operation of such vehicles such
as signal quality and range, real time processing, human expertise, robust
hardware and data security. These challenges can be solved by programming UAVs
to be autonomous, using object detection and tracking, through Computer Vision
algorithms. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that seeks the use of
deep learning to gain a high-level understanding of digital images and videos
for the purpose of automating the task of human visual system. Using computer
vision, algorithms for detecting and tracking various objects can be developed
suitable to the hardware so as to allow real time processing for immediate
judgement. This paper attempts to review the various approaches several authors
have proposed for the purpose of autonomous navigation of UAVs by through
various algorithms of object detection and tracking in real time, for the
purpose of applications in various fields such as disaster management, dense
area exploration, traffic vehicle surveillance etc.

Motivation: 解决生物特征人脸认证在不同人口统计学群体中的公平性和泛化性问题。

Method: 结合ViT和ResNet的预训练全局特征，设计了一个原型网络，并开发了新的数据集进行测试。

Result: 微软Swin Transformer在三个ViT模型中表现最佳。

Conclusion: ViT和ResNet的结合可以提升人脸认证的公平性和泛化性，特别是Swin Transformer表现突出。

Abstract: Biometric face authentication is crucial in computer vision, but ensuring
fairness and generalization across demographic groups remains a big challenge.
Therefore, we investigated whether Vision Transformer (ViT) and ResNet,
leveraging pre-trained global features, can fairly authenticate different
demographic faces while relying minimally on local features. In this
investigation, we used three pre-trained state-of-the-art (SOTA) ViT foundation
models from Facebook, Google, and Microsoft for global features as well as
ResNet-18. We concatenated the features from ViT and ResNet, passed them
through two fully connected layers, and trained on customized face image
datasets to capture the local features. Then, we designed a novel few-shot
prototype network with backbone features embedding. We also developed new
demographic face image support and query datasets for this empirical study. The
network's testing was conducted on this dataset in one-shot, three-shot, and
five-shot scenarios to assess how performance improves as the size of the
support set increases. We observed results across datasets with varying
races/ethnicities, genders, and age groups. The Microsoft Swin Transformer
backbone performed better among the three SOTA ViT for this task. The code and
data are available at: https://github.com/Sufianlab/FairVitBio.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种统一的两阶段训练框架（Q-Ponder），解决了多模态大语言模型在视觉质量评估中评分与解释能力分离的问题，实现了性能与可解释性的双提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将质量评分和推理描述视为分离任务，导致模型在评分精确性和描述可解释性之间存在权衡，限制了多模态大语言模型在视觉质量评估中的潜力。

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：冷启动阶段通过教师模型蒸馏高质量数据，初始化推理能力；强化学习微调阶段引入新型奖励机制（GRPO），联合优化评分准确性和推理一致性。

Result: Q-Ponder在评分回归基准测试中达到SOTA性能，跨域数据集SRCC提升6.5%；在描述准确性和合理性上显著优于基于描述的SOTA模型。

Conclusion: Q-Ponder通过统一框架实现了视觉质量评估中的评分与解释能力的协同优化，展示了在多任务中的泛化潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can
proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments.
However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning
descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading
to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with
precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability.
This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality
assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing.
To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a
cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage.
Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher
model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via
cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize
scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived
from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show
that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score
regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain
datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based
SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in
description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization
potential over diverse tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriPSS是一种新的三模态框架，用于高效提取视频关键帧，通过融合颜色特征、深度结构嵌入和语义上下文，显著提升了视频摘要和检索的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频关键帧提取方法难以全面捕捉视频内容的丰富性，因此需要一种更有效的多模态融合方法。

Method: TriPSS结合CIELAB空间中的颜色特征、ResNet-50的结构嵌入和Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct生成的语义上下文，通过主成分分析和HDBSCAN聚类进行自适应分割，并进一步优化关键帧集。

Result: 在TVSum20和SumMe数据集上，TriPSS表现出色，优于传统单模态和以往的多模态方法。

Conclusion: TriPSS通过多模态融合显著提升了视频内容理解能力，为大规模视频检索设定了新标准。

Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for effective video summarization
and retrieval, yet capturing the complete richness of video content remains
challenging. In this work, we present TriPSS, a novel tri-modal framework that
effectively integrates perceptual cues from color features in the CIELAB space,
deep structural embeddings derived from ResNet-50, and semantic context from
frame-level captions generated by Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. By fusing
these diverse modalities using principal component analysis, TriPSS constructs
robust multi-modal embeddings that enable adaptive segmentation of video
content via HDBSCAN clustering. A subsequent refinement stage incorporating
quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures that the final keyframe set
is both concise and semantically rich. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets TVSum20 and SumMe demonstrate that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art
performance, substantially outperforming traditional unimodal and previous
multi-modal methods. These results underscore TriPSS's ability to capture
nuanced visual and semantic information, thereby setting a new benchmark for
video content understanding in large-scale retrieval scenarios.

TL;DR: Talk2SAM通过结合文本引导改进复杂形状物体的分割，显著提升了SAM-HQ在细长结构和精细边界上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有分割模型（如SAM和SAM-HQ）在分割复杂形状物体时的性能不足问题。

Method: 利用CLIP生成的文本提示嵌入特征，结合DINO特征空间作为额外提示，增强SAM-HQ的分割能力。

Result: 在BIG、ThinObject5K和DIS5K基准测试中，IoU和边界IoU分别提升了5.9%和8.3%。

Conclusion: Talk2SAM通过自然语言引导实现了更灵活、更精确的分割，尤其在传统方法失效的场景下效果显著。

Abstract: Segmenting objects with complex shapes, such as wires, bicycles, or
structural grids, remains a significant challenge for current segmentation
models, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its high-quality variant
SAM-HQ. These models often struggle with thin structures and fine boundaries,
leading to poor segmentation quality. We propose Talk2SAM, a novel approach
that integrates textual guidance to improve segmentation of such challenging
objects. The method uses CLIP-based embeddings derived from user-provided text
prompts to identify relevant semantic regions, which are then projected into
the DINO feature space. These features serve as additional prompts for SAM-HQ,
enhancing its ability to focus on the target object. Beyond improving
segmentation accuracy, Talk2SAM allows user-controllable segmentation, enabling
disambiguation of objects within a single bounding box based on textual input.
We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks: BIG, ThinObject5K, and DIS5K.
Talk2SAM consistently outperforms SAM-HQ, achieving up to +5.9\% IoU and +8.3\%
boundary IoU improvements. Our results demonstrate that incorporating natural
language guidance provides a flexible and effective means for precise object
segmentation, particularly in cases where traditional prompt-based methods
fail. The source code is available on GitHub:

Abstract: Image captioning involves generating textual descriptions from input images,
bridging the gap between computer vision and natural language processing.
Recent advancements in transformer-based models have significantly improved
caption generation by leveraging attention mechanisms for better scene
understanding. While various surveys have explored deep learning-based
approaches for image captioning, few have comprehensively analyzed
attention-based transformer models across multiple languages. This survey
reviews attention-based image captioning models, categorizing them into
transformer-based, deep learning-based, and hybrid approaches. It explores
benchmark datasets, discusses evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr,
and ROUGE, and highlights challenges in multilingual captioning. Additionally,
this paper identifies key limitations in current models, including semantic
inconsistencies, data scarcity in non-English languages, and limitations in
reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions, such as
multimodal learning, real-time applications in AI-powered assistants,
healthcare, and forensic analysis. This survey serves as a comprehensive
reference for researchers aiming to advance the field of attention-based image
captioning.

Motivation: 自动驾驶中视觉语言模型的高延迟和计算开销限制了其实时应用，特别是在已获得高置信度预测后仍需继续推理的场景。

Method: 提出AD-EE框架，结合自动驾驶领域特性和因果推理，确定最优退出层。

Result: 大规模实验显示，AD-EE显著降低了延迟（最高57.58%）并提升了目标检测准确率（最高44%）。

Conclusion: AD-EE有效解决了自动驾驶中VLMs的实时性问题，为实际部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly
common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency
and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical
driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit
over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident
predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE,
an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous
driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We
evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets,
including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle
running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple
VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum
improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy,
with maximum gains of up to 44%.

Abstract: In robot scientific laboratories, visual anomaly detection is important for
the timely identification and resolution of potential faults or deviations. It
has become a key factor in ensuring the stability and safety of experimental
processes. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a VLM-based visual
reasoning approach that supports different levels of supervision through four
progressively informative prompt configurations. To systematically evaluate its
effectiveness, we construct a visual benchmark tailored for process anomaly
detection in scientific workflows. Experiments on two representative
vision-language models show that detection accuracy improves as more contextual
information is provided, confirming the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed reasoning approach for process anomaly detection in scientific
workflows. Furthermore, real-world validations at selected experimental steps
confirm that first-person visual observation can effectively identify
process-level anomalies. This work provides both a data-driven foundation and
an evaluation framework for vision anomaly detection in scientific experiment
workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ODIS通过对象级自蒸馏改进视觉预训练，提升表示质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉预训练方法假设每张图像仅含单个对象，限制了场景中心数据集的可扩展性。

Method: 提出ODIS，利用对象裁剪和掩码注意力实现对象级自蒸馏。

Result: 在ImageNet1k上ViT-Large达到82.6%的k-NN准确率。

Conclusion: ODIS通过对象级任务提升图像和补丁级别的表示能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level
self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly
assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always
hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits
scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity.
We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation
(ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity
from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked
attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer
toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level
task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves
visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at
inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on
ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

TL;DR: 大多数视觉语言模型（VLMs）在视线推断任务中表现不佳，接近于随机猜测，而人类表现接近完美。少数表现较好的VLMs仍受任务难度影响，但具有一定的启发式能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型（VLMs）在视线推断任务中的表现，验证其是否具备类似人类的自然交互能力。

Method: 通过控制实验，比较111个VLMs和65名人类参与者在不同难度和场景条件下的表现，并使用混合效应模型分析行为数据。

Result: 94个VLMs表现等同于随机猜测，人类表现接近完美；少数表现较好的VLMs对任务难度敏感，但对感知变化表现出稳健性。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs缺乏视线推断能力，尚不能实现自然的人类交互，但仍具有发展潜力。

Abstract: Gaze-referential inference--the ability to infer what others are looking
at--is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI
interaction. In a controlled study, we evaluated this skill across 111 Vision
Language Models (VLMs) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and
variability, comparing performance with that of human participants (N = 65),
and analyzed behaviors using mixed-effects models. We found that 94 of the 111
VLMs failed to do better than random guessing, while humans achieved
near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs even respond with each choice almost equally
frequently. Are they randomly guessing? Although most VLMs struggle, when we
zoom in on five of the top-tier VLMs with above-chance performance, we find
that their performance declined with increasing task difficulty but varied only
slightly across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral features
cannot be explained by considering them as random guessers. Instead, they
likely use a combination of heuristics and guessing such that their performance
is subject to the task difficulty but robust to perceptual variations. This
suggests that VLMs, lacking gaze inference capability, have yet to become
technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential
remains.

Method: 提出SAVVY-Bench基准测试和SAVVY推理管道，包括两个阶段：视点空间轨迹估计和动态全局地图构建。

Result: SAVVY显著提升现有AV-LLMs性能，为动态3D空间推理设定了新标准。

Conclusion: SAVVY-Bench和SAVVY方法填补了动态3D空间推理领域的空白，并为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone
of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual
Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on
static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D
spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio.
SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and
moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D
localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose
SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages:
(i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as
other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to
the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map
Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and
converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a
final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the
global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a
new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

Result: 成功转换了Fusion 360和ABC数据集，并通过四个标准用例验证了数据的完整性和与原始STEP文件的兼容性。

Conclusion: 新格式解决了STEP格式的局限性，为机器学习管道提供了更高效和开放的数据处理方案。

Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) generated from computer-aided design (CAD) is
widely used in industry, with several large datasets available. However, the
data in these datasets is represented in STEP format, requiring a CAD kernel to
read and process it. This dramatically limits their scope and usage in large
learning pipelines, as it constrains the possibility of deploying them on
computing clusters due to the high cost of per-node licenses.
  This paper introduces an alternative format based on the open, cross-platform
format HDF5 and a corresponding dataset for STEP files, paired with an
open-source library to query and process them. Our Python package also provides
standard functionalities such as sampling, normals, and curvature to ease
integration in existing pipelines.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our format, we converted the Fusion 360
dataset and the ABC dataset. We developed four standard use cases (normal
estimation, denoising, surface reconstruction, and segmentation) to assess the
integrity of the data and its compliance with the original STEP files.

Conclusion: SPD能有效提取任务相关特征，应对复杂和未见观察，提升视觉强化学习的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-based reinforcement learning requires efficient and robust
representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain
distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It
becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training.
We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant
features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak
and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting
inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set
of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD
outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly
improves the generalization performance for unseen observations. Our code is

Result: 在DeepMind Control和Robosuite测试中，性能分别提升117%和14%。

Conclusion: Dr. G通过自监督学习显著提升MBRL对视觉干扰的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been used to efficiently solve
vision-based control tasks in highdimensional image observations. Although
recent MBRL algorithms perform well in trained observations, they fail when
faced with visual distractions in observations. These task-irrelevant
distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows, and light) may be constantly present in
real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised method,
Dream to Generalize (Dr. G), for zero-shot MBRL. Dr. G trains its encoder and
world model with dual contrastive learning which efficiently captures
task-relevant features among multi-view data augmentations. We also introduce a
recurrent state inverse dynamics model that helps the world model to better
understand the temporal structure. The proposed methods can enhance the
robustness of the world model against visual distractions. To evaluate the
generalization performance, we first train Dr. G on simple backgrounds and then
test it on complex natural video backgrounds in the DeepMind Control suite, and
the randomizing environments in Robosuite. Dr. G yields a performance
improvement of 117% and 14% over prior works, respectively. Our code is

Abstract: In the field of Multi-Person Pose Estimation (MPPE), Radio Frequency
(RF)-based methods can operate effectively regardless of lighting conditions
and obscured line-of-sight situations. Existing RF-based MPPE methods typically
involve either 1) converting RF signals into heatmap images through complex
preprocessing, or 2) applying a deep embedding network directly to raw RF
signals. The first approach, while delivering decent performance, is
computationally intensive and time-consuming. The second method, though simpler
in preprocessing, results in lower MPPE accuracy and generalization
performance. This paper proposes an efficient and lightweight one-stage MPPE
model based on raw RF signals. By sub-grouping RF signals and embedding them
using a shared single-layer CNN followed by multi-head attention, this model
outperforms previous methods that embed all signals at once through a large and
deep CNN. Additionally, we propose a new self-supervised learning (SSL) method
that takes inputs from both one unmasked subgroup and the remaining masked
subgroups to predict the latent representations of the masked data. Empirical
results demonstrate that our model improves MPPE accuracy by up to 15 in
PCKh@0.5 compared to previous methods using raw RF signals. Especially, the
proposed SSL method has shown to significantly enhance performance improvements
when placed in new locations or in front of obstacles at RF antennas,
contributing to greater performance gains as the number of people increases.

TL;DR: SIV-Bench是一个新的视频基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型在社交场景理解、社交状态推理和社交动态预测方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人工智能在理解复杂社交互动中的挑战。

Method: 通过2,792个视频剪辑和8,792个问题-答案对，分析模型在不同社交任务中的表现。

Result: 模型在社交场景理解上表现良好，但在社交状态推理和动态预测上存在瓶颈。

Conclusion: SIV-Bench为开发更具社交智能的AI提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The rich and multifaceted nature of human social interaction, encompassing
multimodal cues, unobservable relations and mental states, and dynamical
behavior, presents a formidable challenge for artificial intelligence. To
advance research in this area, we introduce SIV-Bench, a novel video benchmark
for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) across Social Scene Understanding (SSU), Social State Reasoning (SSR),
and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP). SIV-Bench features 2,792 video clips and
8,792 meticulously generated question-answer pairs derived from a human-LLM
collaborative pipeline. It is originally collected from TikTok and YouTube,
covering a wide range of video genres, presentation styles, and linguistic and
cultural backgrounds. It also includes a dedicated setup for analyzing the
impact of different textual cues-original on-screen text, added dialogue, or no
text. Our comprehensive experiments on leading MLLMs reveal that while models
adeptly handle SSU, they significantly struggle with SSR and SDP, where
Relation Inference (RI) is an acute bottleneck, as further examined in our
analysis. Our study also confirms the critical role of transcribed dialogue in
aiding comprehension of complex social interactions. By systematically
identifying current MLLMs' strengths and limitations, SIV-Bench offers crucial
insights to steer the development of more socially intelligent AI. The dataset

Result: 方法在多模态对抗攻击中表现优于现有技术，成功削弱了多种预训练模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该策略有效揭示了多模态模型的脆弱性，为提升其鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language
processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks
such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to
traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a
challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating
the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and
language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we
train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and
generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial
perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack
strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning
datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results
indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and
single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate
their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art
pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging,
specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal
dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational
cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to
induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify
the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider
temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more
effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method
enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant
to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action
recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

Result: CLIP视觉特征能提供语义信息，但语言解码器在视觉特征不足时可显著恢复性能。

Conclusion: 视觉与语言处理在模型中动态分工，未来可探索更多依赖语言解码器的视觉处理架构。

Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of
multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have
various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language
backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by
contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform
controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our
findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer
ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in
scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the
language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover
performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates
future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language
decoder.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now sufficiently advanced to support a
broad range of applications, including answering complex visual questions, and
are increasingly expected to interact with images in varied ways. To evaluate
them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading
charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However,
such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do
not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception,
reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology,
inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of
synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal
perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with
gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number
of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant.
This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure
analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and
interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities. Our code is available at

Result: FastDrive在决策任务上准确率提升20%，推理速度比7B参数模型快10倍。场景标注（如天气、时间）对决策任务影响显著。

Conclusion: 结构化的数据和高效的模型设计是提升自动驾驶系统性能的关键。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to end-to-end
autonomous driving due to their human-like reasoning capabilities. However,
troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving
applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely
formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce
redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs
hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this
paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which
is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured
representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with
0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and
unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands
structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving
decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive
achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20%
accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive
parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally,
ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g.,
weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance
on decision-making tasks in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote
sensing applications, particularly water body detection. However, deep
learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence
speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this
type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on
two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically,
we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining
the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that
mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore,
cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased
stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR
image segmentation.

Abstract: Image degradation is a prevalent issue in various real-world applications,
affecting visual quality and downstream processing tasks. In this study, we
propose a novel framework that employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to
automatically classify degraded images into predefined categories. The VLM
categorizes an input image into one of four degradation types: (A)
super-resolution degradation (including noise, blur, and JPEG compression), (B)
reflection artifacts, (C) motion blur, or (D) no visible degradation
(high-quality image). Once classified, images assigned to categories A, B, or C
undergo targeted restoration using dedicated models tailored for each specific
degradation type. The final output is a restored image with improved visual
quality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
accurately classifying image degradations and enhancing image quality through
specialized restoration models. Our method presents a scalable and automated
solution for real-world image enhancement tasks, leveraging the capabilities of
VLMs in conjunction with state-of-the-art restoration techniques.

Conclusion: RADAR为图像真实性检测提供了高效、泛化能力强的解决方案，并公开了代码和数据以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Changing facial expressions, gestures, or background details may dramatically
alter the meaning conveyed by an image. Notably, recent advances in diffusion
models greatly improve the quality of image manipulation while also opening the
door to misuse. Identifying changes made to authentic images, thus, becomes an
important task, constantly challenged by new diffusion-based editing tools. To
this end, we propose a novel approach for ReliAble iDentification of inpainted
AReas (RADAR). RADAR builds on existing foundation models and combines features
from different image modalities. It also incorporates an auxiliary contrastive
loss that helps to isolate manipulated image patches. We demonstrate these
techniques to significantly improve both the accuracy of our method and its
generalisation to a large number of diffusion models. To support realistic
evaluation, we further introduce BBC-PAIR, a new comprehensive benchmark, with
images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Our experiments show that RADAR
achieves excellent results, outperforming the state-of-the-art in detecting and
localising image edits made by both seen and unseen diffusion models. Our code,

Motivation: 当前3D占用预测方法依赖密集表示，导致速度慢且难以捕捉动态场景。S2GO旨在解决这些问题，提出更高效的表示方法。

Method: 使用一组紧凑的3D查询，通过时间传播在线更新，并解码为语义高斯；结合去噪渲染目标优化查询和高斯表示。

Result: 在nuScenes和KITTI基准测试中，S2GO的IoU提升了1.5，推理速度快了5.9倍，优于现有方法如GaussianWorld。

Conclusion: 稀疏查询表示在3D占用预测中高效且高性能，适用于动态驾驶场景。

Abstract: Despite the demonstrated efficiency and performance of sparse query-based
representations for perception, state-of-the-art 3D occupancy prediction
methods still rely on voxel-based or dense Gaussian-based 3D representations.
However, dense representations are slow, and they lack flexibility in capturing
the temporal dynamics of driving scenes. Distinct from prior work, we instead
summarize the scene into a compact set of 3D queries which are propagated
through time in an online, streaming fashion. These queries are then decoded
into semantic Gaussians at each timestep. We couple our framework with a
denoising rendering objective to guide the queries and their constituent
Gaussians in effectively capturing scene geometry. Owing to its efficient,
query-based representation, S2GO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
nuScenes and KITTI occupancy benchmarks, outperforming prior art (e.g.,
GaussianWorld) by 1.5 IoU with 5.9x faster inference.

Abstract: Removing reflections is a crucial task in computer vision, with significant
applications in photography and image enhancement. Nevertheless, existing
methods are constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and

5,300 high-quality, pixel-aligned image pairs, each consisting of a reflection
image and its corresponding clean version. Specifically, the dataset is divided
into two parts: 5,000 images are used for training, and 300 images are used for
validation. Additionally, we have included 100 real-world testing images
without ground truth (GT) to further evaluate the practical performance of
reflection removal methods. All image pairs are precisely aligned at the pixel
level to guarantee accurate supervision. The dataset encompasses a broad
spectrum of real-world scenarios, featuring various lighting conditions, object
types, and reflection patterns, and is segmented into training, validation, and
test sets to facilitate thorough evaluation. To validate the usefulness of our
dataset, we train a U-Net-based model and evaluate it using five widely-used
metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS, and NIQE. We will release both the

Abstract: Visual attention is a mechanism closely intertwined with vision and memory.
Top-down information influences visual processing through attention. We
designed a neural network model inspired by aspects of human visual attention.
This model consists of two networks: one serves as a basic processor performing
a simple task, while the other processes contextual information and guides the
first network through attention to adapt to more complex tasks. After training
the model and visualizing the learned attention response, we discovered that
the model's emergent attention patterns corresponded to spatial and
feature-based attention. This similarity between human visual attention and
attention in computer vision suggests a promising direction for studying human
cognition using neural network models.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) videos play a crucial role in many computer vision
applications. Although existing video restoration (VR) methods can
significantly enhance video quality by exploiting temporal information across
video frames, they are typically trained for fixed upscaling factors and lack
the flexibility to handle scales or degradations beyond their training
distribution. In this paper, we introduce VR-INR, a novel video restoration
approach based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that is trained only
on a single upscaling factor ($\times 4$) but generalizes effectively to
arbitrary, unseen super-resolution scales at test time. Notably, VR-INR also
performs zero-shot denoising on noisy input, despite never having seen noisy
data during training. Our method employs a hierarchical
spatial-temporal-texture encoding framework coupled with multi-resolution
implicit hash encoding, enabling adaptive decoding of high-resolution and
noise-suppressed frames from low-resolution inputs at any desired
magnification. Experimental results show that VR-INR consistently maintains
high-quality reconstructions at unseen scales and noise during training,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in sharpness, detail
preservation, and denoising efficacy.

Abstract: Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR) technique plays a crucial role in
image processing by eliminating unwanted reflections from the background. These
reflections, often caused by photographs taken through glass surfaces, can
significantly degrade image quality. SIRR remains a challenging problem due to
the complex and varied reflections encountered in real-world scenarios. These
reflections vary significantly in intensity, shapes, light sources, sizes, and
coverage areas across the image, posing challenges for most existing methods to
effectively handle all cases. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces a U-shaped Fast Fourier Transform Transformer and Hierarchical
Transformer (F2T2-HiT) architecture, an innovative Transformer-based design for
SIRR. Our approach uniquely combines Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Transformer
blocks and Hierarchical Transformer blocks within a UNet framework. The FFT
Transformer blocks leverage the global frequency domain information to
effectively capture and separate reflection patterns, while the Hierarchical
Transformer blocks utilize multi-scale feature extraction to handle reflections
of varying sizes and complexities. Extensive experiments conducted on three
publicly available testing datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance,
validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Recent studies extend the autoregression paradigm to text-to-image
generation, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models. However, our
new PairComp benchmark -- featuring test cases of paired prompts with similar
syntax but different fine-grained semantics -- reveals that existing models
struggle with fine-grained text-image alignment thus failing to realize precise
control over visual tokens. To address this, we propose FocusDiff, which
enhances fine-grained text-image semantic alignment by focusing on subtle
differences between similar text-image pairs. We construct a new dataset of
paired texts and images with similar overall expressions but distinct local
semantics, further introducing a novel reinforcement learning algorithm to
emphasize such fine-grained semantic differences for desired image generation.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing text-to-image
benchmarks and significantly outperforms prior methods on PairComp.

TL;DR: MORSE-500是一个新的多模态推理视频基准，填补了现有静态图像基准的不足，通过动态视频和多样化推理任务测试模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补现有基准的三大不足：静态图像的局限性、狭窄的数学问题解决焦点以及易饱和性。

Method: 通过程序化生成的500个视频（结合Manim、Matplotlib、MoviePy等工具），涵盖六类推理任务，支持难度动态调整。

Result: 测试显示当前先进模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro和OpenAI o3）在多类任务中存在明显性能差距，尤其在抽象和规划任务上。

Conclusion: MORSE-500提供了一个可扩展的基准，支持未来多模态推理研究的透明和可重复评估。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks
for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they
overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal
complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on
mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning
skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal
capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many
benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure
modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal
Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully
scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning
categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic
Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and
curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control
over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling
difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static
benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:
its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily
challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing
next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems --
including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest
available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal
substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large
deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset,
generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent,
reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

TL;DR: YoursProtoP是一种交互式策略，通过用户反馈个性化视觉概念，解决了概念不一致性问题，同时保持模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于概念的神经网络解释存在概念不一致问题，且无法根据用户偏好调整，导致解释难以理解。

Method: 引入了YoursProtoP，一种允许用户个性化原型的交互策略，通过用户监督调整和拆分概念。

Result: 在FunnyBirds、CUB、CARS和PETS数据集上验证了YoursProtoP能实现概念一致性且不损失准确性。

Conclusion: YoursProtoP通过用户交互显著提升了概念解释的可理解性和一致性。

Abstract: Concept-based interpretable neural networks have gained significant attention
due to their intuitive and easy-to-understand explanations based on case-based
reasoning, such as "this bird looks like those sparrows". However, a major
limitation is that these explanations may not always be comprehensible to users
due to concept inconsistency, where multiple visual features are
inappropriately mixed (e.g., a bird's head and wings treated as a single
concept). This inconsistency breaks the alignment between model reasoning and
human understanding. Furthermore, users have specific preferences for how
concepts should look, yet current approaches provide no mechanism for
incorporating their feedback. To address these issues, we introduce
YoursProtoP, a novel interactive strategy that enables the personalization of
prototypical parts - the visual concepts used by the model - according to user
needs. By incorporating user supervision, YoursProtoP adapts and splits
concepts used for both prediction and explanation to better match the user's
preferences and understanding. Through experiments on both the synthetic
FunnyBirds dataset and a real-world scenario using the CUB, CARS, and PETS
datasets in a comprehensive user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
YoursProtoP in achieving concept consistency without compromising the accuracy
of the model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编码器缺乏时间意识，而视频模型在密集预测任务上表现不佳，因此需要一种能够兼顾时空一致性的视频编码器。

Method: FRAME通过自监督学习预测当前和未来的DINO补丁特征，同时利用CLIP的语义空间对齐类标记，适用于密集预测和语言驱动任务。

Result: 在七个数据集的六个密集预测任务中，FRAME表现优于图像编码器和现有视频模型，同时保持了紧凑的架构。

Conclusion: FRAME填补了现有方法的不足，为密集视频理解任务提供了一种高效且多功能的解决方案。

Abstract: Dense video prediction tasks, such as object tracking and semantic
segmentation, require video encoders that generate temporally consistent,
spatially dense features for every frame. However, existing approaches fall
short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video
models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense
prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame
encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current
and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to
spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge,
FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense
prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual
correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with
CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video
classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven
datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing
self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a
compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.

Conclusion: 研究表明，3D技术可以通过融合和细化策略有效改进动态场景的分割，为未来的3D视觉研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Computer vision is largely based on 2D techniques, with 3D vision still
relegated to a relatively narrow subset of applications. However, by building
on recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors
have shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from
independent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is
particularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is
significant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In
fact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques
are ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in
particular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this
issue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D
by fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered
radiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long,
dynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric
structure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the
(incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time
refinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing
the data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the
refinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that
surpass the 2D baseline by a large margin. This demonstrates that 3D techniques
can enhance 2D analysis even for dynamic phenomena in a challenging and
realistic setting.

Motivation: 大模型在视觉感知和推理方面取得了显著进展，但在处理视觉模糊或非语义文本时容易产生语义正确但视觉错误的答案（语义幻觉）。论文旨在研究其成因并提出解决方案。

Method: 提出两个核心组件：ZoomText（无需外部检测器的粗到细文本区域识别）和Grounded Layer Correction（利用不易幻觉的层级表示指导解码）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效缓解语义幻觉，并在公共基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为大模型处理非语义文本提供了一种新思路，无需额外训练即可提升性能。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in visual
perception and reasoning. However, when confronted with visually ambiguous or
non-semantic scene text, they often struggle to accurately spot and understand
the content, frequently generating semantically plausible yet visually
incorrect answers, which we refer to as semantic hallucination. In this work,
we investigate the underlying causes of semantic hallucination and identify a
key finding: Transformer layers in LLM with stronger attention focus on scene
text regions are less prone to producing semantic hallucinations. Thus, we
propose a training-free semantic hallucination mitigation framework comprising
two key components: (1) ZoomText, a coarse-to-fine strategy that identifies
potential text regions without external detectors; and (2) Grounded Layer
Correction, which adaptively leverages the internal representations from layers
less prone to hallucination to guide decoding, correcting hallucinated outputs
for non-semantic samples while preserving the semantics of meaningful ones. To
enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of over
1,730 samples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually
curated question-answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates semantic
hallucination but also achieves strong performance on public benchmarks for
scene text spotting and understanding.

Conclusion: EX-4D通过创新的几何表示和训练策略，显著提升了极端视角下视频生成的质量。

Abstract: Generating high-quality camera-controllable videos from monocular input is a
challenging task, particularly under extreme viewpoint. Existing methods often
struggle with geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts in boundaries,
leading to degraded visual quality. In this paper, we introduce EX-4D, a novel
framework that addresses these challenges through a Depth Watertight Mesh
representation. The representation serves as a robust geometric prior by
explicitly modeling both visible and occluded regions, ensuring geometric
consistency in extreme camera pose. To overcome the lack of paired multi-view
datasets, we propose a simulated masking strategy that generates effective
training data only from monocular videos. Additionally, a lightweight
LoRA-based video diffusion adapter is employed to synthesize high-quality,
physically consistent, and temporally coherent videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EX-4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
physical consistency and extreme-view quality, enabling practical 4D video
generation.

Motivation: 3DGS和SLAM方法在速度和场景规模上存在局限性，需要一种能够实时处理的方法。

Method: 结合快速初始姿态估计和直接采样高斯原语，通过增量式处理和聚类优化实现高效联合优化。

Result: 方法能够实时处理多种捕获场景和规模，在速度和图像质量上表现优越。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在大规模场景和宽基线拍摄中具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Radiance field methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) allow easy
reconstruction from photos, enabling free-viewpoint navigation. Nonetheless,
pose estimation using Structure from Motion and 3DGS optimization can still
each take between minutes and hours of computation after capture is complete.
SLAM methods combined with 3DGS are fast but struggle with wide camera
baselines and large scenes. We present an on-the-fly method to produce camera
poses and a trained 3DGS immediately after capture. Our method can handle dense
and wide-baseline captures of ordered photo sequences and large-scale scenes.
To do this, we first introduce fast initial pose estimation, exploiting learned
features and a GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment. We then introduce direct
sampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning
primitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two
efficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian
primitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing
scalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives,
storing them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives
are progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint.
We evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that our solution
can provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes
we target while remaining competitive with other methods that only handle
specific capture styles or scene sizes in speed, image quality, or both.

Abstract: Recent advancements in camera-based occupancy prediction have focused on the
simultaneous prediction of 3D semantics and scene flow, a task that presents
significant challenges due to specific difficulties, e.g., occlusions and
unbalanced dynamic environments. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and
their underlying causes. To address them, we propose a novel regularization
framework called VoxelSplat. This framework leverages recent developments in 3D
Gaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i) Enhanced
Semantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method
decodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them
onto the 2D camera view. This provides additional supervision signals in the
camera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D
semantics. (ii) Scene Flow Learning: Our framework uses the predicted scene
flow to model the motion of Gaussians, and is thus able to learn the scene flow
of moving objects in a self-supervised manner using the labels of adjacent
frames. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy
models, enhancing performance without increasing inference time. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelSplat
in improving the accuracy of both semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation.

TL;DR: PartCrafter是一个结构化3D生成模型，能从单张RGB图像联合生成多个语义明确且几何上独立的3D网格。它采用统一的组合生成架构，无需预分割输入，通过同时去噪多个3D部件实现端到端的部件感知生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法要么生成单一的3D形状，要么依赖两阶段流程（先分割图像再重建每个部分），无法实现部件感知的端到端生成。PartCrafter旨在解决这一问题，提供更灵活且高效的3D生成能力。

Method: PartCrafter基于预训练的3D网格扩散变换器（DiT），引入两个关键创新：1）组合潜在空间，每个3D部件由解耦的潜在令牌表示；2）层次化注意力机制，确保局部细节与全局一致性的平衡。

Result: 实验表明，PartCrafter在生成可分解的3D网格方面优于现有方法，即使在输入图像中不可直接观察到的部件也能生成，展示了部件感知生成的优越性。

Conclusion: PartCrafter通过创新的组合生成架构和层次化注意力机制，为3D理解和合成提供了强大的部件感知生成先验，代码和训练数据将公开。

Abstract: We introduce PartCrafter, the first structured 3D generative model that
jointly synthesizes multiple semantically meaningful and geometrically distinct
3D meshes from a single RGB image. Unlike existing methods that either produce
monolithic 3D shapes or follow two-stage pipelines, i.e., first segmenting an
image and then reconstructing each segment, PartCrafter adopts a unified,
compositional generation architecture that does not rely on pre-segmented
inputs. Conditioned on a single image, it simultaneously denoises multiple 3D
parts, enabling end-to-end part-aware generation of both individual objects and
complex multi-object scenes. PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh
diffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained
weights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A
compositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of
disentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables
structured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts,
ensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation.
To support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level
annotations from large-scale 3D object datasets. Experiments show that
PartCrafter outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D
meshes, including parts that are not directly visible in input images,
demonstrating the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding
and synthesis. Code and training data will be released.

Result: 在复杂退化和单一退化数据集上均表现优异，尤其在复杂退化图像上性能提升显著。

Conclusion: UniRes通过统一框架和灵活扩展，有效解决了复杂退化图像恢复问题，展示了强大的泛化能力和性能优势。

Abstract: Real-world image restoration is hampered by diverse degradations stemming
from varying capture conditions, capture devices and post-processing pipelines.
Existing works make improvements through simulating those degradations and
leveraging image generative priors, however generalization to in-the-wild data
remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we focus on complex degradations,
i.e., arbitrary mixtures of multiple types of known degradations, which is
frequently seen in the wild. A simple yet flexible diffusionbased framework,
named UniRes, is proposed to address such degradations in an end-to-end manner.
It combines several specialized models during the diffusion sampling steps,
hence transferring the knowledge from several well-isolated restoration tasks
to the restoration of complex in-the-wild degradations. This only requires
well-isolated training data for several degradation types. The framework is
flexible as extensions can be added through a unified formulation, and the
fidelity-quality trade-off can be adjusted through a new paradigm. Our proposed
method is evaluated on both complex-degradation and single-degradation image
restoration datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental
results show consistent performance gain especially for images with complex
degradations.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在所有退化任务中均表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过任务定义、不平衡量化和数据平衡的协调优化，本文方法显著提升了Real-SR的性能。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-SR) is a challenging problem due to
the complex degradation patterns in low-resolution images. Unlike approaches
that assume a broadly encompassing degradation space, we focus specifically on
achieving an optimal balance in how SR networks handle different degradation
patterns within a fixed degradation space. We propose an improved paradigm that
frames Real-SR as a data-heterogeneous multi-task learning problem, our work
addresses task imbalance in the paradigm through coordinated advancements in
task definition, imbalance quantification, and adaptive data rebalancing.
Specifically, we introduce a novel task definition framework that segments the
degradation space by setting parameter-specific boundaries for degradation
operators, effectively reducing the task quantity while maintaining task
discrimination. We then develop a focal loss based multi-task weighting
mechanism that precisely quantifies task imbalance dynamics during model
training. Furthermore, to prevent sporadic outlier samples from dominating the
gradient optimization of the shared multi-task SR model, we strategically
convert the quantified task imbalance into controlled data rebalancing through
deliberate regulation of task-specific training volumes. Extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistent
superiority across all degradation tasks.

Conclusion: 基于LLM的先验方法为可扩展的开放世界视觉理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Understanding relationships between objects is central to visual
intelligence, with applications in embodied AI, assistive systems, and scene
understanding. Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a
fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key
challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but
unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work
introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by
expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating
candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and
training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence
(maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond
annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally,
we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21
held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed.
Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving
mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on
these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors
for scalable open-world visual understanding.

Conclusion: ADR-MVS通过自适应深度范围和法线引导策略，显著提升了航空影像的三维重建效果。

Abstract: Three-dimensional digital urban reconstruction from multi-view aerial images
is a critical application where deep multi-view stereo (MVS) methods outperform
traditional techniques. However, existing methods commonly overlook the key
differences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth
ranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with
low-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive
Depth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve
multi-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth
range predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal
estimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the
range map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth
boundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating
convergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are
progressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for
precise depth regression. Moreover, a normal-guided cost aggregation operation
is specially devised for aerial stereo images to improve geometric awareness
within the cost volume. Finally, we introduce a normal-guided depth refinement
module that surpasses existing RGB-guided techniques. Experimental results
demonstrate that ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WHU,
LuoJia-MVS, and M\"unchen datasets, while exhibits superior computational
complexity.

Motivation: 当前工具在颅外组织分割领域缺乏广泛验证，尤其是在发育中的大脑或病理情况下。TissUnet旨在填补这一空白，提供快速、准确且可重复的分割。

Method: 使用155对MRI-CT扫描训练模型，并在九个数据集（涵盖广泛年龄范围和脑肿瘤患者）中验证。模型性能通过Dice系数和专家人工标注进行评估。

Result: TissUnet在健康成人中的Dice系数中位数为0.79，在健康个体和肿瘤患者中分别为0.83和0.81，优于现有方法。89%的接受率和盲测表现优异。

Conclusion: TissUnet能够高效分割颅外组织，支持大规模研究，如颅面形态、治疗效果和代谢风险的评估。

Abstract: Extracranial tissues visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may
hold significant value for characterizing health conditions and clinical
decision-making, yet they are rarely quantified. Current tools have not been
widely validated, particularly in settings of developing brains or underlying
pathology. We present TissUnet, a deep learning model that segments skull bone,
subcutaneous fat, and muscle from routine three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI,
with or without contrast enhancement. The model was trained on 155 paired
MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering
a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to
AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice
coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second
validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR:
0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art method. Acceptability testing resulted
in an 89% acceptance rate after adjudication by a tie-breaker(N=108 MRIs), and
TissUnet demonstrated excellent performance in the blinded comparative review
(N=45 MRIs), including both healthy and tumor cases in pediatric populations.
TissUnet enables fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation of extracranial
tissues, supporting large-scale studies on craniofacial morphology, treatment
effects, and cardiometabolic risk using standard brain T1w MRI.

*Yuhan Hao,Zhengning Li,Lei Sun,Weilong Wang,Naixin Yi,Sheng Song,Caihong Qin,Mofan Zhou,Yifei Zhan,Peng Jia,Xianpeng Lang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveAction是首个专为VLA模型设计的动作驱动基准测试，包含16,185个QA对和2,610个驾驶场景，通过真实驾驶数据和用户操作标注，提出了树状评估框架，实验显示视觉和语言输入对动作预测至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型的基准测试缺乏场景多样性、可靠的动作标注和符合人类偏好的评估机制。

Method: 利用真实驾驶数据生成QA对，提供高级离散动作标签，并设计树状评估框架链接视觉、语言和动作任务。

Result: 实验表明，视觉和语言输入同时缺失时，动作预测准确率下降8.0%，框架能精准识别模型瓶颈。

Conclusion: DriveAction为自动驾驶中的人类决策提供了新见解和严格基础。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but
existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level
annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. To address
these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark
specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from
2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data
proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to
ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete
action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and
implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that
explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both
comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language
guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3%
without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without
either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks
with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous
foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法主要依赖2D图像特征，而3D场景的表示对MLLMs至关重要，但存在挑战。本研究旨在探索更有效的3D表示方法。

Method: 系统比较了基于视频和基于点的3D表示方法，提出了一种结合3D点云特征的新方法，使用Sonata预训练的Point Transformer V3编码器。

Result: 实验表明，显式融合3D特征显著提升性能，且基于点的表示在巧妙采样和排序下可与基于视频的方法媲美。最佳模型在多个3D理解基准上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 研究强调了3D表示方法的重要性，并通过透明报告多种子下的平均结果，推动领域稳健发展。

Abstract: Effectively representing 3D scenes for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is crucial yet challenging. Existing approaches commonly only rely on
2D image features and use varied tokenization approaches. This work presents a
rigorous study of 3D token structures, systematically comparing video-based and
point-based representations while maintaining consistent model backbones and
parameters. We propose a novel approach that enriches visual tokens by
incorporating 3D point cloud features from a Sonata pretrained Point
Transformer V3 encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that merging explicit 3D
features significantly boosts performance. Furthermore, we show that
point-based token structures can rival video-based ones when the points are
cleverly sampled and ordered. Our best models from both structures achieve
state-of-the-art results on multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. We emphasize
our analysis of token structures as a key contribution, alongside transparent
reporting of results averaged over multiple seeds, a practice we believe is
vital for robust progress in the field.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MoralCLIP的新方法，通过多模态学习结合道德基础理论，扩展了视觉语言模型的道德维度理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型缺乏对内容道德维度的理解和推理能力，而这是人类认知的重要方面。

Method: 提出MoralCLIP方法，基于道德基础理论（MFT），将视觉和文本道德线索整合到统一的嵌入空间中，实现跨模态道德对齐。利用多标签数据集Social-Moral Image Database，并通过道德数据增强策略扩增标注数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，显式的道德监督提高了单模态和多模态对道德内容的理解能力，为构建具有道德意识的AI系统奠定了基础。

Conclusion: MoralCLIP为AI系统识别和与人类道德价值观对齐提供了新方法，填补了现有模型的道德理解空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled rich semantic
understanding across modalities. However, these encoding methods lack the
ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial
aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal
learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT).
Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding
space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the
multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral
foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data
augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs
labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit
moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral
content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of
recognizing and aligning with human moral values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视觉Transformer计算成本高，动态压缩标记（如剪枝或合并）成为研究热点，但现有方法会造成信息丢失且需要后训练。本文旨在统一标记压缩过程以减少信息丢失并提高效率。

Method: 提出一个多对多的标记变换框架，将标记压缩过程统一为矩阵变换，保留更多信息，并实现无需训练的加速。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在减少40% FLOPs的同时，将DeiT-S加速1.5倍，仅损失0.1%准确率。在密集预测任务中也表现出色，实现了更好的计算-性能权衡。

Conclusion: 该通用框架不仅为标记压缩提供了新视角，还能显著提升计算效率和模型性能，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Vision transformers have been widely explored in various vision tasks. Due to
heavy computational cost, much interest has aroused for compressing vision
transformer dynamically in the aspect of tokens. Current methods mainly pay
attention to token pruning or merging to reduce token numbers, in which tokens
are compressed exclusively, causing great information loss and therefore
post-training is inevitably required to recover the performance. In this paper,
we rethink token reduction and unify the process as an explicit form of token
matrix transformation, in which all existing methods are constructing special
forms of matrices within the framework. Furthermore, we propose a many-to-many
Token Transforming framework that serves as a generalization of all existing
methods and reserves the most information, even enabling training-free
acceleration. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework.
Specifically, we reduce 40% FLOPs and accelerate DeiT-S by $\times$1.5 with
marginal 0.1% accuracy drop. Furthermore, we extend the method to dense
prediction tasks including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation,
and language model generation. Results demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently achieves substantial improvements, offering a better
computation-performance trade-off, impressive budget reduction and inference
acceleration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多阶段方法在高计算成本和实时性能上表现不佳，需要一种更高效的单阶段解决方案。

Method: 使用统一网络生成点级语义标签和质心偏移，结合聚类算法区分实例，通过分离和对齐NPCS区域恢复姿态和大小。

Result: 在GAPart数据集上验证了方法的姿态估计能力，并在真实场景中以200Hz的频率实现了实时反馈。

Conclusion: YOEO方法在性能和效率上优于现有方法，适用于机器人交互任务。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for
articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown
promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level.
However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that
first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the
Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These
approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in
real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a
single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS
representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate
point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same
part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering
algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances.
Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the
separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size.
Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation
capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our
synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual
feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen
articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our
proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决数字边界逼近问题，比较不同评估指标的有效性，尤其是加权功劳和Rosin指标的关系。

Method: 通过理论分析、实验验证和统计检验（Pearson相关系数），证明两者的独立性。

Result: 两种指标在理论上和实验上均无相关性，因此不能互相替代。

Conclusion: 加权功劳无法替代Rosin指标，两者评估结果可能不一致。

Abstract: Many studies had been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a
digital boundary by piece straight-line segments for further processing
required in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared
their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the
goodness of a polygonal approximation was figure of merit. Later, it was
pointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason
and this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure
called merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal
approximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness
of an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit
as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An
attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures -
weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be
used instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis,
experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The
mathematical formula for weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are
analyzed and through proof of theorems it is found that the two measures are
independent of each other theoretically. The graphical analysis of experiments
carried out using public dataset supports theoretical analysis. The statistical
analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient also establishes that the two
measures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a
sub-optimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other sub-optimal
scheme as indicated by Rosin's measure then the same conclusion cannot be drawn
using weighted figure of merit and so one cannot use weighted figure of merit
instead of Rosin's measure.

intermediate representations that encourage crucial invariance and reprojection
consistency. We evaluated our method on four synthetic and three real datasets
and conducted extensive ablation studies on our design choices. Despite
training solely on simulated data, our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance and can generalize to real-world scenarios with multiple
trajectories, opening up a range of applications in sport analysis and virtual

Motivation: 人类容易受到光学错觉的影响，这为研究感官和认知过程提供了工具。研究旨在探索机器是否也表现出类似的倾向，并解决以往研究中未区分实际和明显特征的局限性。

Method: 通过构建一个视觉问答（VQA）数据集，分为真实错觉和虚假错觉，并配以对照图像，评估LVLMs在这些任务中的表现，以及它们是否能区分实际和明显特征。

Result: 研究发现，尽管LVLMs可能看似能识别错觉并正确回答问题，但它们对真实和虚假错觉问题的答案相同，表明其回答可能基于先前的错觉知识而非真正的视觉理解。

Conclusion: LVLMs对视觉错觉的反应可能依赖于先验知识而非实际视觉处理，揭示了其在视觉认知上的局限性。数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools
for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision
studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision
language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions.
However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished
actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine
cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question
answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along
with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies
between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same
actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar
geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and
fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and
apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to
recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types,
they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA
questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge
of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶感知系统中的传感器融合面临数据延迟带来的挑战，不同传感器的时序不一致会导致物体状态估计不准确，严重影响轨迹预测的质量和安全性。

Method: 1. 为LiDAR和雷达（相对于相机）设计每点时间戳偏移特征，提高传感器融合的时间感知精度；2. 通过数据增强模拟实际车辆部署中的传感器延迟模式。

Result: 与传统模型相比，该方法在传感器数据同步和延迟情况下均表现出稳定且良好的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了自动驾驶感知系统在传感器数据延迟条件下的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in
autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors
arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal
misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state
estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are
critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address
this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar
both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor
fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor
staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into
a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple
LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model
shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach
reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale
conditions.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have gained wide adoption in the virtual human
generation due to their outstanding expressiveness. However, their substantial
computational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time
interactive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration
requirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video
generation framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges.
Firstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the
minimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions,
which significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a
consistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure
real-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization
and pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference
speed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and
model quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for
long-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and
low latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate
class labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking,
listening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for
fine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent
capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
low-latency, fluid, and authentic two-way communication. On an NVIDIA RTX
4090D, our model achieves a maximum of 78 FPS at a resolution of 384x384 and 45
FPS at a resolution of 512x512, with an initial video generation latency of 140
ms and 215 ms, respectively.

Abstract: In the field of 3D medical imaging, accurately extracting and representing
the blood vessels with curvilinear structures holds paramount importance for
clinical diagnosis. Previous methods have commonly relied on discrete
representation like mask, often resulting in local fractures or scattered
fragments due to the inherent limitations of the per-pixel classification
paradigm. In this work, we introduce DeformCL, a new continuous representation
based on Deformable Centerlines, where centerline points act as nodes connected
by edges that capture spatial relationships. Compared with previous
representations, DeformCL offers three key advantages: natural connectivity,
noise robustness, and interaction facility. We present a comprehensive training
pipeline structured in a cascaded manner to fully exploit these favorable
properties of DeformCL. Extensive experiments on four 3D vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.
Furthermore, the visualization of curved planar reformation images validates
the clinical significance of the proposed framework. We release the code in

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多尺度特征融合方法，通过将UNet解码过程视为初始值问题并利用线性多步法，解决了传统UNet中跳跃连接的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统UNet的跳跃连接存在多尺度特征交互不足和信息整合方式简单的问题，而现有改进方法主要关注编码器和解码器的能力提升，忽略了这些局限性。

Method: 将UNet解码过程建模为初始值问题，并采用线性多步法，提出了一种自适应的多尺度特征融合方法。

Result: 在多个医学图像分割数据集上取得了更好的特征利用效果，减少了网络参数，同时保持了高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法独立于编码器和解码器架构，可灵活应用于各种UNet类网络，显著提升了多尺度特征融合的效果。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet
serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is
the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant
limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different
scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which
constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet
have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations
remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale
feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an
initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By
leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive
ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature
fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures,
making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC,
KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets
demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and
maintained high performance. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于FPGA的DIF滤波器硬件架构，用于处理事件视觉传感器的高噪声数据流，并通过新的高分辨率事件数据集验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件视觉领域快速发展，但传感器数据流中存在大量噪声，亟需高效滤波解决方案。

Method: 设计并实现了基于FPGA的DIF滤波器架构，并通过新数据集评估性能。

Result: DIF滤波器的吞吐量高达403.39 MEPS（1280x720分辨率）和428.45 MEPS（640x480分辨率），AUROC指数在0.844至0.999之间，优于现有滤波方案。

Conclusion: DIF滤波器在高吞吐量和宽噪声范围内表现优异，为事件视觉领域提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been rapid development in the field of event
vision. It manifests itself both on the technical side, as better and better
event sensors are available, and on the algorithmic side, as more and more
applications of this technology are proposed and scientific papers are
published. However, the data stream from these sensors typically contains a
significant amount of noise, which varies depending on factors such as the
degree of illumination in the observed scene or the temperature of the sensor.
We propose a hardware architecture of the Distance-based Interpolation with
Frequency Weights (DIF) filter and implement it on an FPGA chip. To evaluate
the algorithm and compare it with other solutions, we have prepared a new
high-resolution event dataset, which we are also releasing to the community.
Our architecture achieved a throughput of 403.39 million events per second
(MEPS) for a sensor resolution of 1280 x 720 and 428.45 MEPS for a resolution
of 640 x 480. The average values of the Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (AUROC) index ranged from 0.844 to 0.999, depending on the
dataset, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art filtering solutions, but
with much higher throughput and better operation over a wide range of noise
levels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FontAdapter是一个快速生成未见字体视觉文本的框架，通过两阶段课程学习实现高效字体定制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像扩散模型在字体控制上依赖于预定义字体字典，对未见字体的适配效率低下。

Method: 提出两阶段课程学习：首先从孤立字形提取字体属性，再将这些风格融入自然背景；构建合成数据集支持训练。

Result: 实验表明FontAdapter无需额外微调即可高效定制未见字体，支持视觉文本编辑、字体风格混合和跨语言字体转换。

Conclusion: FontAdapter是一个高效、多功能的字体定制框架，显著提升了未见字体的生成速度和灵活性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the seamless
integration of visual text into diverse image contexts. Recent approaches
further improve control over font styles through fine-tuning with predefined
font dictionaries. However, adapting unseen fonts outside the preset is
computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes, making real-time
customization impractical. In this paper, we present FontAdapter, a framework
that enables visual text generation in unseen fonts within seconds, conditioned
on a reference glyph image. To this end, we find that direct training on font
datasets fails to capture nuanced font attributes, limiting generalization to
new glyphs. To overcome this, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning
approach: FontAdapter first learns to extract font attributes from isolated
glyphs and then integrates these styles into diverse natural backgrounds. To
support this two-stage training scheme, we construct synthetic datasets
tailored to each stage, leveraging large-scale online fonts effectively.
Experiments demonstrate that FontAdapter enables high-quality, robust font
customization across unseen fonts without additional fine-tuning during
inference. Furthermore, it supports visual text editing, font style blending,
and cross-lingual font transfer, positioning FontAdapter as a versatile
framework for font customization tasks.

Abstract: In this report, we present a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation
approach for the object correspondence task in the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence
Challenges 2025. Given object queries from one perspective (e.g., ego view),
the goal is to predict the corresponding object masks in another perspective
(e.g., exo view). To tackle this task, we propose a multimodal condition fusion
module that enhances object localization by leveraging both visual masks and
textual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the
visual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object
alignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives,
thereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed
method ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object
correspondence benchmark. Code will be made available at

TL;DR: ChronoTailor是一种基于扩散模型的视频虚拟试衣框架，通过时空注意力机制和多尺度特征整合，解决了现有方法在连续性和细节保留上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频虚拟试衣方法在保持时间连续性和还原衣物细节方面存在困难，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: ChronoTailor采用区域感知的空间引导和注意力驱动的时间特征融合机制，整合多尺度衣物特征并实现衣物姿态对齐。

Result: 实验表明，ChronoTailor在时空连续性和细节保留上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ChronoTailor通过创新的时空注意力机制和特征整合，实现了高质量的视频虚拟试衣效果。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly replace the clothing of a person in a
source video with a target garment. Despite significant progress in this field,
existing approaches still struggle to maintain continuity and reproduce garment
details. In this paper, we introduce ChronoTailor, a diffusion-based framework
that generates temporally consistent videos while preserving fine-grained
garment details. By employing a precise spatio-temporal attention mechanism to
guide the integration of fine-grained garment features, ChronoTailor achieves
robust try-on performance. First, ChronoTailor leverages region-aware spatial
guidance to steer the evolution of spatial attention and employs an
attention-driven temporal feature fusion mechanism to generate more continuous
temporal features. This dual approach not only enables fine-grained local
editing but also effectively mitigates artifacts arising from video dynamics.
Second, ChronoTailor integrates multi-scale garment features to preserve
low-level visual details and incorporates a garment-pose feature alignment to
ensure temporal continuity during dynamic motion. Additionally, we collect
StyleDress, a new dataset featuring intricate garments, varied environments,
and diverse poses, offering advantages over existing public datasets, and will
be publicly available for research. Extensive experiments show that
ChronoTailor maintains spatio-temporal continuity and preserves garment details
during motion, significantly outperforming previous methods.

Motivation: 解决传统皮肤刺测试（SPT）结果一致性问题，开发自动化检测方法。

Method: 结合神经网络像素级分割与算法化检测，利用32张多光源图像。

Result: 32张多光源图像比单光源图像显著提高准确性。

Conclusion: SPAT设备的多图像方法优于传统单图像方法。

Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing
sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)
device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32
images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which
leads to a diagnosis.
  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected
inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate
wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by
drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT
device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a
custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural
network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an
algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the
wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation
set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted
image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions
offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional,
uniform light.

TL;DR: 论文提出CryoFastAR，一种几何基础模型，用于直接从无序冷冻电镜图像预测姿态，实现快速从头重构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电镜中的姿态估计和3D重构依赖耗时的迭代优化，原因是低信噪比和对比传递函数失真。

Method: 集成多视图特征，通过大规模模拟冷冻电镜数据训练，并采用渐进式训练策略。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，CryoFastAR显著加速推理，且质量与传统方法相当。

Conclusion: CryoFastAR为冷冻电镜提供了一种高效且准确的姿态估计解决方案。

Abstract: Pose estimation from unordered images is fundamental for 3D reconstruction,
robotics, and scientific imaging. Recent geometric foundation models, such as
DUSt3R, enable end-to-end dense 3D reconstruction but remain underexplored in
scientific imaging fields like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for
near-atomic protein reconstruction. In cryo-EM, pose estimation and 3D
reconstruction from unordered particle images still depend on time-consuming
iterative optimization, primarily due to challenges such as low signal-to-noise
ratios (SNR) and distortions from the contrast transfer function (CTF). We
introduce CryoFastAR, the first geometric foundation model that can directly
predict poses from Cryo-EM noisy images for Fast ab initio Reconstruction. By
integrating multi-view features and training on large-scale simulated cryo-EM
data with realistic noise and CTF modulations, CryoFastAR enhances pose
estimation accuracy and generalization. To enhance training stability, we
propose a progressive training strategy that first allows the model to extract
essential features under simpler conditions before gradually increasing
difficulty to improve robustness. Experiments show that CryoFastAR achieves
comparable quality while significantly accelerating inference over traditional
iterative approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.

TL;DR: Domain-RAG是一个无需训练的检索引导图像生成框架，用于跨域小样本目标检测（CD-FSOD），通过背景检索与生成解决域对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如图像生成）难以保持目标域的背景一致性，Domain-RAG旨在解决这一问题。

Method: Domain-RAG分为三步：域感知背景检索、域引导背景生成、前景-背景组合。

Result: 在多个任务（如CD-FSOD）中表现优异，超越现有基准。

Conclusion: Domain-RAG无需额外训练即可生成高质量、域一致的样本，效果显著。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel objects
with only a handful of labeled samples from previously unseen domains. While
data augmentation and generative methods have shown promise in few-shot
learning, their effectiveness for CD-FSOD remains unclear due to the need for
both visual realism and domain alignment. Existing strategies, such as
copy-paste augmentation and text-to-image generation, often fail to preserve
the correct object category or produce backgrounds coherent with the target
domain, making them non-trivial to apply directly to CD-FSOD. To address these
challenges, we propose Domain-RAG, a training-free, retrieval-guided
compositional image generation framework tailored for CD-FSOD. Domain-RAG
consists of three stages: domain-aware background retrieval, domain-guided
background generation, and foreground-background composition. Specifically, the
input image is first decomposed into foreground and background regions. We then
retrieve semantically and stylistically similar images to guide a generative
model in synthesizing a new background, conditioned on both the original and
retrieved contexts. Finally, the preserved foreground is composed with the
newly generated domain-aligned background to form the generated image. Without
requiring any additional supervision or training, Domain-RAG produces
high-quality, domain-consistent samples across diverse tasks, including
CD-FSOD, remote sensing FSOD, and camouflaged FSOD. Extensive experiments show
consistent improvements over strong baselines and establish new
state-of-the-art results. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: HMVLM 通过认知启发的架构和创新提示方法，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的性能和安全性。

Abstract: We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving
framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow
architecture. A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake
commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates
high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck"
without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective
five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2)
multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene
Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and
(3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and
sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to
achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025

Result: 在DGM4数据集上取得最先进的性能，尤其是对虚假内容的定位效果显著。

Conclusion: CSCL方法通过细粒度一致性学习有效提升了虚假信息的检测和定位能力。

Abstract: To tackle the threat of fake news, the task of detecting and grounding
multi-modal media manipulation DGM4 has received increasing attention. However,
most state-of-the-art methods fail to explore the fine-grained consistency
within local content, usually resulting in an inadequate perception of detailed
forgery and unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
named Contextual-Semantic Consistency Learning (CSCL) to enhance the
fine-grained perception ability of forgery for DGM4. Two branches for image and
text modalities are established, each of which contains two cascaded decoders,
i.e., Contextual Consistency Decoder (CCD) and Semantic Consistency Decoder
(SCD), to capture within-modality contextual consistency and across-modality
semantic consistency, respectively. Both CCD and SCD adhere to the same
criteria for capturing fine-grained forgery details. To be specific, each
module first constructs consistency features by leveraging additional
supervision from the heterogeneous information of each token pair. Then, the
forgery-aware reasoning or aggregating is adopted to deeply seek forgery cues
based on the consistency features. Extensive experiments on DGM4 datasets prove
that CSCL achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially for the results
of grounding manipulated content. Codes and weights are avaliable at

Result: 在HaNSeg和SegRap2023数据集上实现SOTA性能，尤其在小器官分割上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了医学图像分割的精度，特别是对小器官的分割效果显著。

Abstract: Medical segmentation plays an important role in clinical applications like
radiation therapy and surgical guidance, but acquiring clinically acceptable
results is difficult. In recent years, progress has been witnessed with the
success of utilizing transformer-like models, such as combining the attention
mechanism with CNN. In particular, transformer-based segmentation models can
extract global information more effectively, compensating for the drawbacks of
CNN modules that focus on local features. However, utilizing transformer
architecture is not easy, because training transformer-based models can be
resource-demanding. Moreover, due to the distinct characteristics in the
medical field, especially when encountering mid-sized and small organs with
compact regions, their results often seem unsatisfactory. For example, using
ViT to segment medical images directly only gives a DSC of less than 50\%,
which is far lower than the clinically acceptable score of 80\%. In this paper,
we used Mask2Former with deformable attention to reduce computation and
proposed offset adjustment strategies to encourage sampling points within the
same organs during attention weights computation, thereby integrating compact
foreground information better. Additionally, we utilized the 4th feature map in
Mask2Former to provide a coarse location of organs, and employed an FCN-based
auxiliary head to help train Mask2Former more quickly using Dice loss. We show
that our model achieves SOTA (State-of-the-Art) performance on the HaNSeg and
SegRap2023 datasets, especially on mid-sized and small organs.Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前半监督分割评估仅关注精度而忽略可靠性和鲁棒性的问题，为安全关键应用（如自动驾驶）提供更全面的模型评估标准。

Method: 引入了Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS)，通过谐波平均结合预测精度、校准和不确定性质量指标，全面评估模型。

Result: 实验表明半监督方法可能在精度和可靠性之间权衡，而UniMatchV2在域外评估中表现鲁棒但仍存在可靠性不足。

Conclusion: 呼吁采用RSS等更全面的评估指标，以更好地满足实际部署需求。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly
pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised
approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised
segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world
deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively
focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and
robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse
conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as
meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable
environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we
introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines
predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a
harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing
an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models.
Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a
supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability
for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's
robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We
advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like
RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world
deployment needs.

Conclusion: FADE通过充分利用预训练模型的先验信息，提供了一种高效、高质量的视频编辑解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video
editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts.
However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in
handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like
motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality
results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy
computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image
editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a
training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages
the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware
factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the
attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are
distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose
a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role.
Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling
trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and
supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and
temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that
our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally
coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code is

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to
impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless,
jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time
responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper,
we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive
framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO
comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual
vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences
with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and
(2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that
generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly
reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce
a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under
textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including
HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or
superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based
methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance,
streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.

TL;DR: Dy3DGS-SLAM是一种基于3D高斯泼溅的动态场景SLAM方法，使用单目RGB输入，解决了动态环境中的跟踪与重建问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF或3DGS的SLAM方法在静态场景表现优秀，但在动态环境中表现不佳，尤其依赖RGB-D输入。Dy3DGS-SLAM针对这些问题，提出了纯RGB输入的解决方案。

Method: 通过概率模型融合光流掩码和深度掩码生成动态掩码，设计运动损失约束位姿估计网络，并在建模阶段利用渲染损失消除动态干扰。

Result: 实验表明，Dy3DGS-SLAM在动态环境中实现了最先进的跟踪与渲染性能，甚至优于一些现有RGB-D方法。

Conclusion: Dy3DGS-SLAM为动态场景的SLAM提供了一种高效的单目RGB解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Current Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods based on Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting excel in reconstructing static
3D scenes but struggle with tracking and reconstruction in dynamic
environments, such as real-world scenes with moving elements. Existing
NeRF-based SLAM approaches addressing dynamic challenges typically rely on
RGB-D inputs, with few methods accommodating pure RGB input. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. To address dynamic
interference, we fuse optical flow masks and depth masks through a
probabilistic model to obtain a fused dynamic mask. With only a single network
iteration, this can constrain tracking scales and refine rendered geometry.
Based on the fused dynamic mask, we designed a novel motion loss to constrain
the pose estimation network for tracking. In mapping, we use the rendering loss
of dynamic pixels, color, and depth to eliminate transient interference and
occlusion caused by dynamic objects. Experimental results demonstrate that
Dy3DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking and rendering in dynamic
environments, outperforming or matching existing RGB-D methods.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了领域适应（DA）技术在农业图像分析中的应用，强调了其在解决跨领域泛化挑战中的重要性，并系统回顾了相关方法和数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业图像分析因环境差异、作物类型和数据采集方法不同而面临领域差距问题，需要DA技术提升模型的跨领域泛化能力。

Method: 将DA方法分为浅层和深度学习模型，进一步细分为监督、半监督和无监督方法，特别关注对抗学习技术。

Result: DA技术在作物健康监测、害虫检测和果实识别中显著提升了模型在不同区域和季节的性能。

Conclusion: 本文为农业图像分析中的DA研究提供了全面框架，指出了当前的研究空白，推动了该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: With the increasing use of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has
become crucial for tasks like crop health monitoring and pest detection.
However, significant domain shifts between source and target domains-due to
environmental differences, crop types, and data acquisition methods-pose
challenges. These domain gaps limit the ability of models to generalize across
regions, seasons, and complex agricultural environments. This paper explores
how Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges, focusing on
their role in enhancing the cross-domain transferability of agricultural image
analysis. DA has gained attention in agricultural vision tasks due to its
potential to mitigate domain heterogeneity. The paper systematically reviews
recent advances in DA for agricultural imagery, particularly its practical
applications in complex agricultural environments. We examine the key drivers
for adopting DA in agriculture, such as limited labeled data, weak model
transferability, and dynamic environmental conditions. We also discuss its use
in crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, highlighting
improvements in performance across regions and seasons. The paper categorizes
DA methods into shallow and deep learning models, with further divisions into
supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. A special focus is
given to adversarial learning-based DA methods, which have shown great promise
in challenging agricultural scenarios. Finally, we review key public datasets
in agricultural imagery, analyzing their value and limitations in DA research.
This review provides a comprehensive framework for researchers, offering
insights into current research gaps and supporting the advancement of DA
methods in agricultural image analysis.

*Zonglin Wu,Yule Xue,Xin Wei,Yiren Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 介绍了MCA-Bench，一个统一的多模态基准测试工具，用于评估CAPTCHA的安全性，揭示了其漏洞并提出改进设计原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CAPTCHA方案多样但缺乏统一的基准测试工具，限制了对其安全性的全面评估。

Method: 通过共享的视觉-语言模型微调专门破解代理，整合多种CAPTCHA类型到统一评估协议中。

Result: MCA-Bench揭示了现代CAPTCHA设计的漏洞，并首次量化分析了挑战复杂性、交互深度和模型可解性的关系。

Conclusion: 提出三个实用的CAPTCHA设计原则，并指出未来研究方向，推动了系统化CAPTCHA加固和社区合作。

Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical
defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes
encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and
obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based
questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal
benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this
gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking
suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation
protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune
specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent,
cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench
effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under
varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of
how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate.
Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and
identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA
hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and
code are available online.

*Yifu Qiu,Yftah Ziser,Anna Korhonen,Shay B. Cohen,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉与语言基础模型是否具备真实世界模型（观察→行动→观察）和动态模型（观察→观察→行动）的能力，发现通过监督微调动态模型更容易；进而提出两种基于动态模型引导世界模型的方法，并在图像编辑任务中提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究视觉与语言基础模型是否具备真实世界模型和动态模型的能力，并寻找有效的微调和引导方法，以提升模型性能。

Method: 1）利用动态模型为未标注的视频帧对标注行动以扩展训练数据；2）提出基于识别模型预测重要性的新目标；3）通过动态模型为世界模型生成样本评分，引导推理时搜索。

Result: 在Aurora-Bench的动作中心图像编辑任务中，最佳模型性能优于现有模型15%（基于GPT4o评分），并在所有子集上达到最佳人类评价。

Conclusion: 动态模型可以有效地引导世界模型的构建，并在实际任务中显著提升性能。

Abstract: To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic
world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a
dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when
actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models
struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model
through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In
turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main
strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference
time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for
unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We
further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are
weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly,
the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model
to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the
world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric
image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance
competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a
margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and
achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.

Method: 使用预训练深度学习模型提取深层特征表示，结合机器学习模型进行分类。

Result: 该方法在多种评估设置下表现出优异的分类性能、泛化能力和鲁棒性，同时保持训练和推理效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际临床部署提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Orthopoxvirus infections must be accurately classified from medical pictures
for an easy and early diagnosis and epidemic prevention. The necessity for
automated and scalable solutions is highlighted by the fact that traditional
diagnostic techniques can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation
and there are few and biased data sets of the different types of Orthopox. In
order to improve classification performance and lower computational costs, a
hybrid strategy is put forth in this paper that uses Machine Learning models
combined with pretrained Deep Learning models to extract deep feature
representations without the need for augmented data. The findings show that
this feature extraction method, when paired with other methods in the
state-of-the-art, produces excellent classification outcomes while preserving
training and inference efficiency. The proposed approach demonstrates strong
generalization and robustness across multiple evaluation settings, offering a
scalable and interpretable solution for real-world clinical deployment.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低分辨率输入下的立体视频生成质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能从小型合成立体视频数据集微调，还能应用于低质量真实视频，同时实现生成和修复功能。

Abstract: Stereo video generation has been gaining increasing attention with recent
advancements in video diffusion models. However, most existing methods focus on
generating 3D stereoscopic videos from monocular 2D videos. These approaches
typically assume that the input monocular video is of high quality, making the
task primarily about inpainting occluded regions in the warped video while
preserving disoccluded areas. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline that
not only generates stereo videos but also enhances both left-view and
right-view videos consistently with a single model. Our approach achieves this
by fine-tuning the model on degraded data for restoration, as well as
conditioning the model on warped masks for consistent stereo generation. As a
result, our method can be fine-tuned on a relatively small synthetic stereo
video datasets and applied to low-quality real-world videos, performing both
stereo video generation and restoration. Experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively in
stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为SSNI的新框架，通过样本特定的噪声注入改进扩散净化方法，利用预训练的分数网络自适应调整每个样本的噪声水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散净化方法对所有样本使用固定噪声水平，而作者发现不同样本的最优噪声水平不同，因此提出自适应调整噪声的想法。

Method: SSNI框架使用预训练的分数网络估计样本偏离干净数据分布的程度，并通过加权函数动态调整每个样本的噪声水平。

Result: 实验表明，SSNI框架显著提升了CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K上的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 为不同样本分配不同噪声水平是扩散净化方法的关键改进方向。

Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise
from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward
diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse
generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected
to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled
by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this
paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be
different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should
be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new
framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).
Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data
point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,
based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to
adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise
injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods
results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels
to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: HAVIR是一种通过结合fMRI数据和生成模型重构视觉信息的新方法，利用两个适配器分别捕捉拓扑结构和语义信息，显著提升了复杂视觉刺激的重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在从fMRI解码复杂视觉刺激时仍有挑战，主要因其元素密集多样、空间结构复杂和语义信息丰富。

Method: HAVIR提出两个适配器：AutoKL捕捉拓扑结构，CLIP提取语义信息，并通过Versatile Diffusion融合生成最终图像。

Result: 实验表明，HAVIR在复杂场景中能有效重建视觉刺激的结构和语义信息，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: HAVIR为解决复杂视觉刺激重建问题提供了一种有效的方法，结合了拓扑和语义信息的优势。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between
neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in
decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in
accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from
their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and
multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1)
The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior,
capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to
CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These
complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the
final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information
from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions
describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images
synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that
HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic
information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing
models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于“角树”的线性成本张量处理层（FIS），用于图像和高阶张量数据，表现优异且参数更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习中，高维张量数据处理需要高效且低成本的解决方案。

Method: 利用“角树”数学工具，构建了线性成本的张量处理层（FIS），可无缝集成到现有网络中。

Result: 在图像分类和异常检测任务中表现优异，参数量和计算量大幅减少，性能接近更大模型。

Conclusion: FIS层为高维数据处理提供了高效且轻量的解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern
deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the
need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than
for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost
in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from
the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we
provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing
pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order
generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a
multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums).
The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer
called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with
other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both
classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a
smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of
only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also
used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of
97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing
and modelling codes are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于CNN的红外小目标检测方法忽视了浅层与深层特征的异质性，导致特征协作效率低下，且缺乏对跨层次特征的系统性建模。

Method: SDS-Net采用双分支架构，分别建模特征的结枸特性与语义属性，并引入自适应特征融合模块动态建模跨层特征相关性。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，SDS-Net在检测精度和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SDS-Net具有高检测精度、低计算复杂性和高推理效率，展现了广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally
overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to
inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information
and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency
relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack
systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of
multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring
substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that
efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the
detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net
introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural
characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving
shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby
achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed.
Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to
dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature
collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three
public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational
complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection
performance and broad application prospects. Our code will be made public at

Motivation: 尽管大规模预训练的视觉语言模型在医学图像分析中展现出强大的迁移能力，但其可靠性尚未得到充分研究。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出全适应一致性预测（full conformal adaptation）框架，结合训练免费的线性探针方法（SS-Text），通过少样本适应集对每个测试数据点进行转导适应性调整。

Result: 实验使用了3种医学专用的VLMs和9个适应任务，结果显示该方法在保持相同覆盖保证的同时，效率提升了高达27%。

Conclusion: 该框架为预训练基础模型的适应性和一致性预测提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了医学图像分析的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained at large scale have shown
unprecedented transferability capabilities and are being progressively
integrated into medical image analysis. Although its discriminative potential
has been widely explored, its reliability aspect remains overlooked. This work
investigates their behavior under the increasingly popular split conformal
prediction (SCP) framework, which theoretically guarantees a given error level
on output sets by leveraging a labeled calibration set. However, the zero-shot
performance of VLMs is inherently limited, and common practice involves
few-shot transfer learning pipelines, which cannot absorb the rigid
exchangeability assumptions of SCP. To alleviate this issue, we propose full
conformal adaptation, a novel setting for jointly adapting and conformalizing
pre-trained foundation models, which operates transductively over each test
data point using a few-shot adaptation set. Moreover, we complement this
framework with SS-Text, a novel training-free linear probe solver for VLMs that
alleviates the computational cost of such a transductive approach. We provide
comprehensive experiments using 3 different modality-specialized medical VLMs
and 9 adaptation tasks. Our framework requires exactly the same data as SCP,
and provides consistent relative improvements of up to 27% on set efficiency
while maintaining the same coverage guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统小麦管理依赖人工专家检查，成本高且难以规模化。VLMs虽具潜力，但因缺乏领域知识导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出WisWheat数据集，包含预训练、定量测量和指令微调三层数据，用于微调VLMs。

Result: 微调后的Qwen2.5 VL 7B在小麦压力和生长阶段任务中准确率分别达79.2%和84.6%，显著优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: WisWheat数据集有效提升VLMs在小麦管理中的性能，为农业智能化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Wheat management strategies play a critical role in determining yield.
Traditional management decisions often rely on labour-intensive expert
inspections, which are expensive, subjective and difficult to scale. Recently,
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to enable
scalable, data-driven management support. However, due to a lack of
domain-specific knowledge, directly applying VLMs to wheat management tasks
results in poor quantification and reasoning capabilities, ultimately producing
vague or even misleading management recommendations. In response, we propose
WisWheat, a wheat-specific dataset with a three-layered design to enhance VLM
performance on wheat management tasks: (1) a foundational pretraining dataset
of 47,871 image-caption pairs for coarsely adapting VLMs to wheat morphology;
(2) a quantitative dataset comprising 7,263 VQA-style image-question-answer
triplets for quantitative trait measuring tasks; and (3) an Instruction
Fine-tuning dataset with 4,888 samples targeting biotic and abiotic stress
diagnosis and management plan for different phenological stages. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source VLMs (e.g.,
Qwen2.5 7B) on our dataset leads to significant performance improvements.
Specifically, the Qwen2.5 VL 7B fine-tuned on our wheat instruction dataset
achieves accuracy scores of 79.2% and 84.6% on wheat stress and growth stage
conversation tasks respectively, surpassing even general-purpose commercial
models such as GPT-4o by a margin of 11.9% and 34.6%.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应的反馈引导方法（FBG），用于改进条件扩散模型中的样本保真度，避免了传统Classifier-Free Guidance（CFG）因固定引导尺度导致多样性和记忆问题的缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CFG在条件扩散模型中使用固定引导尺度，可能损害样本多样性并引发记忆问题。FBG旨在通过动态调整引导尺度来解决这一问题。

Method: FBG通过假设条件分布受无条件分布线性污染，引入状态依赖性系数来自适应调整引导量。该方法利用自身预测的反馈动态调整引导，无需固定超参数。

Result: 在ImageNet512x512上，FBG显著优于CFG，并与Limited Interval Guidance（LIG）性能相当。此外，在文本到图像生成中，FBG能根据提示复杂度自动调整引导尺度。

Conclusion: FBG提供了一种基于数学框架的自适应引导方法，不仅提升了样本质量，还能与其他引导方案（如CFG或LIG）灵活结合。

Abstract: While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become standard for improving sample
fidelity in conditional diffusion models, it can harm diversity and induce
memorization by applying constant guidance regardless of whether a particular
sample needs correction. We propose FeedBack Guidance (FBG), which uses a
state-dependent coefficient to self-regulate guidance amounts based on need.
Our approach is derived from first principles by assuming the learned
conditional distribution is linearly corrupted by the unconditional
distribution, contrasting with CFG's implicit multiplicative assumption. Our
scheme relies on feedback of its own predictions about the conditional signal
informativeness to adapt guidance dynamically during inference, challenging the
view of guidance as a fixed hyperparameter. The approach is benchmarked on
ImageNet512x512, where it significantly outperforms Classifier-Free Guidance
and is competitive to Limited Interval Guidance (LIG) while benefitting from a
strong mathematical framework. On Text-To-Image generation, we demonstrate
that, as anticipated, our approach automatically applies higher guidance scales
for complex prompts than for simpler ones and that it can be easily combined
with existing guidance schemes such as CFG or LIG.

these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and
subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where
relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple
modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must
dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the
query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that
jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text,
and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal
backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic
modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training
data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale
synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in
various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we
propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard
contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality
usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation
strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade
performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR
consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR
improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4
over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream
utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50%
boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on
LongVideoBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在长视频理解中的困难，通过模拟人类逐步思考，精准选择相关镜头。

Method: 采用链式镜头推理，逐步选择相关镜头并粗到细分析，实现多模态推理。

Result: 在主流长视频QA基准上表现优异，优于基线模型，且效率和准确性突出。

Conclusion: VideoChat-A1为长视频理解提供了高效且准确的解决方案，接近闭源模型的性能但更高效。

Abstract: The recent advance in video understanding has been driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos,
while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer
context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been
proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a
long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video
is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long
video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human.
Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy
temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To
fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm.
Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long
videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it
can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into
these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the
shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking
process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for
thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our
VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long
video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema,
outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and
InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source
GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with
7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.

TL;DR: BiLIE框架通过高频滤波和双向交叉注意力融合解决低光图像增强中的噪声和结构不连续问题，并提出新数据集RELIE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧相机在极低光环境下易丢失细节并产生运动模糊，现有事件相机方法忽视全局低频噪声和局部结构不连续性问题。

Method: 提出BiLIE框架，包含基于高频滤波的事件特征增强模块（EFE）和双向交叉注意力融合机制（BCAF）。

Result: BiLIE在PSNR和LPIPS指标上分别优于现有最佳方法0.96dB和0.03。

Conclusion: BiLIE有效解决低光图像增强中的噪声和结构问题，并通过新数据集RELIE提升实验可靠性。

Abstract: Under extreme low-light conditions, traditional frame-based cameras, due to
their limited dynamic range and temporal resolution, face detail loss and
motion blur in captured images. To overcome this bottleneck, researchers have
introduced event cameras and proposed event-guided low-light image enhancement
algorithms. However, these methods neglect the influence of global
low-frequency noise caused by dynamic lighting conditions and local structural
discontinuities in sparse event data. To address these issues, we propose an
innovative Bidirectional guided Low-light Image Enhancement framework (BiLIE).
Specifically, to mitigate the significant low-frequency noise introduced by
global illumination step changes, we introduce the frequency high-pass
filtering-based Event Feature Enhancement (EFE) module at the event
representation level to suppress the interference of low-frequency information,
and preserve and highlight the high-frequency edges.Furthermore, we design a
Bidirectional Cross Attention Fusion (BCAF) mechanism to acquire high-frequency
structures and edges while suppressing structural discontinuities and local
noise introduced by sparse event guidance, thereby generating smoother fused
representations.Additionally, considering the poor visual quality and color
bias in existing datasets, we provide a new dataset (RELIE), with high-quality
ground truth through a reliable enhancement scheme. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed BiLIE outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 0.96dB in PSNR and 0.03 in LPIPS.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖高质量的矢量输入和计算密集的Transformer架构，实践中难以获取或生成，且部署成本高。

Result: 在所有指标上达到最先进性能，并在2024 Waymo挑战赛排行榜中排名第一。

Conclusion: CCLSTM提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案，显著提升占据流预测性能。

Abstract: Predicting future states of dynamic agents is a fundamental task in
autonomous driving. An expressive representation for this purpose is Occupancy
Flow Fields, which provide a scalable and unified format for modeling motion,
spatial extent, and multi-modal future distributions. While recent methods have
achieved strong results using this representation, they often depend on
high-quality vectorized inputs, which are unavailable or difficult to generate
in practice, and the use of transformer-based architectures, which are
computationally intensive and costly to deploy. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{Coupled Convolutional LSTM (CCLSTM)}, a lightweight, end-to-end
trainable architecture based solely on convolutional operations. Without
relying on vectorized inputs or self-attention mechanisms, CCLSTM effectively
captures temporal dynamics and spatial occupancy-flow correlations using a
compact recurrent convolutional structure. Despite its simplicity, CCLSTM
achieves state-of-the-art performance on occupancy flow metrics and, as of this
submission, ranks \(1^{\text{st}}\) in all metrics on the 2024 Waymo Occupancy

TL;DR: 该论文构建了一个层次化的高光谱作物数据集（H2Crop），结合高光谱EnMAP数据和Sentinel-2时间序列，提出了一种双流Transformer架构用于细粒度作物分类，实验表明高光谱数据的加入能显著提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度作物分类对精准农业和粮食安全监测至关重要，但当前研究因高光谱数据获取和标注成本高的挑战而较少结合多时相卫星数据和高光谱影像。

Method: 构建H2Crop数据集，并提出双流Transformer架构，分别通过光谱-空间Transformer提取高光谱特征，时态Swin Transformer提取时间序列模式，结合层次分类头实现多级分类。

Result: 实验显示高光谱数据的加入使平均F1分数提升4.2%（峰值6.3%），且方法在多种场景下优于现有深度学习模型。

Conclusion: H2Crop为细粒度作物分类和高光谱图像处理提供了基准，证明了高光谱数据与时间序列结合的显著优势。

Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and
food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological
dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and
subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from
hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce
currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types
annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical
hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP
hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated
field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a
vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and
hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer
architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates
two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained
signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer
extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed
hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously
delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments
demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series
yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive
comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep
learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of
hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了新的基准MF$^2$，用于评估模型对完整电影内容的叙事理解能力，通过手动构建的真实与虚假主张对进行测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在长视频内容理解上存在局限，现有基准过于关注细节或依赖自动化生成的问题，无法反映真实理解。

Method: 构建包含50多部电影的基准，每部电影配对850多个手动构建的“真实-虚假”主张对，测试模型对核心叙事元素的理解。

Result: 实验表明，现有模型在识别真实与虚假主张上的表现远低于人类，突显其叙事理解能力的不足。

Conclusion: MF$^2$为评估模型的长视频叙事理解提供了一个更精确的基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic
understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge,
partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral,
``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval
over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically
generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are
easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this
paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can
comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length
movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,
open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs
-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.
These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and
emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that
humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice
formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models
must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases
like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our
experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art
models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of
the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over
critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

Motivation: 在工业自动化和教育等领域，实时视频分析以纠正错误的需求日益增长，但目前的方法主要关注程序性错误，忽略了其他错误类型。

Method: 提出了一个在线错误检测框架，能够同时处理程序性和执行性错误，并在检测到错误时使用大型语言模型生成反馈。

Abstract: In this report, we address the task of online mistake detection, which is
vital in domains like industrial automation and education, where real-time
video analysis allows human operators to correct errors as they occur. While
previous work focuses on procedural errors involving action order, broader
error types must be addressed for real-world use. We introduce an online
mistake detection framework that handles both procedural and execution errors
(e.g., motor slips or tool misuse). Upon detecting an error, we use a large
language model (LLM) to generate explanatory feedback. Experiments on the
HoloAssist benchmark confirm the effectiveness of our approach, where our
approach is placed second on the mistake detection task.

Conclusion: SatelliteFormula 为复杂环境变量的建模提供了可解释的解决方案，连接了数据驱动学习和物理理解之间的桥梁。

Abstract: We propose SatelliteFormula, a novel symbolic regression framework that
derives physically interpretable expressions directly from multi-spectral
remote sensing imagery. Unlike traditional empirical indices or black-box
learning models, SatelliteFormula combines a Vision Transformer-based encoder
for spatial-spectral feature extraction with physics-guided constraints to
ensure consistency and interpretability. Existing symbolic regression methods
struggle with the high-dimensional complexity of multi-spectral data; our
method addresses this by integrating transformer representations into a
symbolic optimizer that balances accuracy and physical plausibility. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets and remote sensing tasks demonstrate superior
performance, stability, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. SatelliteFormula enables interpretable modeling of complex
environmental variables, bridging the gap between data-driven learning and

Conclusion: STSBench填补了时空评估的空白，为开发更强健和可解释的自动驾驶VLM提供了支持。

Abstract: We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic
understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The
framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset
using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for
efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model
evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first
benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs
based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target
off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint
and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk
assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert
VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or
LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle
actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial
capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios
spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified
multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings
in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in
complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for
architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By
addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the
development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image
retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications
remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot
action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind,
that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental
representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task
of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored
setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through
multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful
interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with
clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or
abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective
for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative
multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to
explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic
visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to
refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully
automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing
interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with
a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation
for future research in this direction.

Abstract: While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to
generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown
promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first
large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs)
for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a
diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and
extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions:
(1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can
they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3)
How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context?
Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception
tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels
comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates
significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that
specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models
across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet
optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight
the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique
challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for
the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key
areas for improvement in medical visual language models.

Abstract: Training deep learning models on petabyte-scale Earth observation (EO) data
requires separating compute resources from data storage. However, standard
PyTorch data loaders cannot keep modern GPUs utilized when streaming GeoTIFF
files directly from cloud storage. In this work, we benchmark GeoTIFF loading
throughput from both cloud object storage and local SSD, systematically testing
different loader configurations and data parameters. We focus on tile-aligned
reads and worker thread pools, using Bayesian optimization to find optimal
settings for each storage type. Our optimized configurations increase remote
data loading throughput by 20x and local throughput by 4x compared to default
settings. On three public EO benchmarks, models trained with optimized remote
loading achieve the same accuracy as local training within identical time
budgets. We improve validation IoU by 6-15% and maintain 85-95% GPU utilization

Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在视觉问答方面取得了进展，但AI系统在概念化能力（即识别和推理不同视觉形式下的同一概念）上仍存在显著差距，这是人类推理的基本能力。

Method: 通过创建VGA数据集，包含六种基于图的任务，使用多样化的图布局（如Kamada-Kawai与平面图）来测试AI在视觉形式无关的推理能力。

Result: 实验显示，人类在任务中表现近乎完美，而最先进的视觉模型和多模态LLMs在图同构检测任务中完全失败，在路径/循环任务中表现有限，表明其仅进行伪智能模式匹配而非真正理解。

Conclusion: VGA揭示了当前AI模型在视觉理解中的基本限制，并为推动AI视觉模型向人类概念化能力迈进提供了框架。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have driven
breakthroughs in visual question answering. Yet, a critical gap persists,
`conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept
despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To
address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset
featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems'
capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g.,
Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form.
Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a
striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while
models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in
path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting
pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These
findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual
understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant
reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like
conceptualization in AI visual models. The Visual Graph Arena is available at:

Abstract: Perceiving the world from both egocentric (first-person) and exocentric
(third-person) perspectives is fundamental to human cognition, enabling rich
and complementary understanding of dynamic environments. In recent years,
allowing the machines to leverage the synergistic potential of these dual
perspectives has emerged as a compelling research direction in video
understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of video
understanding from both exocentric and egocentric viewpoints. We begin by
highlighting the practical applications of integrating egocentric and
exocentric techniques, envisioning their potential collaboration across
domains. We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications.
Next, we systematically organize and review recent advancements into three main
research directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric
understanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis,
and (3) joint learning frameworks that unify both perspectives. For each

*Jonathan Schmidt,Simon Giebenhain,Matthias Niessner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BecomingLit是一种新方法，用于重建可从新视角交互式渲染的高分辨率头部虚拟化身。通过低成本光照场景捕获和多数据集，结合3D高斯基元和混合神经着色，显著优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以实现高分辨率、可重新光照的头部虚拟化身重建，且成本高、效率低。因此，提出一种低成本方法，结合新数据集和混合技术，提升效果。

Method: 提出低成本光照场景捕获系统，收集多光照、多表情数据集；使用3D高斯基元表示虚拟化身，结合参数化头部模型和表情动态模块，采用混合神经着色技术。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在重新光照和重演方面显著优于现有技术，支持点光源和环境光，且可通过单目视频动画控制。

Conclusion: BecomingLit通过创新数据集和混合技术，实现了高效、高分辨率的虚拟化身重建，在交互性和效果上优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce BecomingLit, a novel method for reconstructing relightable,
high-resolution head avatars that can be rendered from novel viewpoints at
interactive rates. Therefore, we propose a new low-cost light stage capture
setup, tailored specifically towards capturing faces. Using this setup, we
collect a novel dataset consisting of diverse multi-view sequences of numerous
subjects under varying illumination conditions and facial expressions. By
leveraging our new dataset, we introduce a new relightable avatar
representation based on 3D Gaussian primitives that we animate with a
parametric head model and an expression-dependent dynamics module. We propose a
new hybrid neural shading approach, combining a neural diffuse BRDF with an
analytical specular term. Our method reconstructs disentangled materials from
our dynamic light stage recordings and enables all-frequency relighting of our
avatars with both point lights and environment maps. In addition, our avatars
can easily be animated and controlled from monocular videos. We validate our
approach in extensive experiments on our dataset, where we consistently
outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in relighting and reenactment by a
significant margin.

TL;DR: STARFlow是一种基于归一化流的可扩展生成模型，结合了Transformer自回归流的理论优势，实现了高分辨率图像合成的强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索归一化流在高分辨率图像生成中的潜力，结合Transformer的自回归能力，提升生成效果和计算效率。

Method: 提出TARFlow（Transformer自回归流）作为核心，结合深层和浅层的Transformer块设计，利用预训练自编码器的隐空间建模，以及新指导算法提升样本质量。

Result: STARFlow在类和文本条件图像生成任务中表现优异，样本质量接近最先进的扩散模型。

Conclusion: STARFlow首次展示了归一化流在大规模和高分辨率任务中的有效性，为生成模型提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows
that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core
of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the
expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities
of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality
of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation,
we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to
significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep
Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,
complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally
efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of
pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level
modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample
quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling
exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.
STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and
text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion
models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful
demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and
resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在精细理解人类物理技能方面存在不足，需要一个新的基准来评估和提升专家级别的理解能力。

Method: 构建包含11种物理活动的3521个视频问答对，测试模型从五个候选答案中选择正确答案的能力。

Result: 最佳模型GPT-40仅达到44.70%的准确率，远低于人类专家的82.02%，显示出显著的性能差距。

Conclusion: ExAct将为开发能精确理解物理和程序性领域人类技能的视觉语言模型提供重要基准。

Abstract: We present ExAct, a new video-language benchmark for expert-level
understanding of skilled physical human activities. Our new benchmark contains
3521 expert-curated video question-answer pairs spanning 11 physical activities
in 6 domains: Sports, Bike Repair, Cooking, Health, Music, and Dance. ExAct
requires the correct answer to be selected from five carefully designed
candidate options, thus necessitating a nuanced, fine-grained, expert-level
understanding of physical human skills. Evaluating the recent state-of-the-art
VLMs on ExAct reveals a substantial performance gap relative to human expert
performance. Specifically, the best-performing GPT-4o model achieves only
44.70% accuracy, well below the 82.02% attained by trained human
specialists/experts. We believe that ExAct will be beneficial for developing
and evaluating VLMs capable of precise understanding of human skills in various
physical and procedural domains. Dataset and code are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出一种新型双路径架构CoMemo和位置编码机制RoPE-DHR，解决了传统LVLM在注意力分配和位置编码上的不足，提升了多模态处理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于大型语言模型的视觉-语言模型在多模态处理中存在注意力分配不均和位置编码失效的问题，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出双路径架构CoMemo（Context路径和Memory路径）和新型位置编码RoPE-DHR，分别优化视觉信息处理和保持2D空间关系。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在长上下文理解、多图像推理和视觉问答任务上。

Conclusion: CoMemo通过创新设计有效解决了传统LVLM的局限性，显著提升了多模态任务的表现。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models built upon Large Language
Models have established aligning visual features with LLM representations as
the dominant paradigm. However, inherited LLM architectural designs introduce
suboptimal characteristics for multimodal processing. First, LVLMs exhibit a
bimodal distribution in attention allocation, leading to the progressive
neglect of middle visual content as context expands. Second, conventional
positional encoding schemes fail to preserve vital 2D structural relationships
when processing dynamic high-resolution images. To address these limitations,
we propose CoMemo - a dual-path architecture that combines a Context image path
with an image Memory path for visual processing, effectively alleviating visual
information neglect. Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional
encoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to
maintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended
sequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context
comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering,
demonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM
architectures. Project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前地观测（EO）领域的深度学习模型受限于训练数据的规模、地理覆盖和光谱多样性，难以实现全局可迁移的表征学习。

Method: 提出TerraFM，利用多模态数据（雷达与光学）作为自然增强，通过局部-全局对比学习和双中心机制解决长尾分布问题。

Result: 在GEO-Bench和Copernicus-Bench的分类与分割任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: TerraFM通过创新的自监督方法和数据策略，显著提升了地球观测任务的泛化能力。

Abstract: Modern Earth observation (EO) increasingly leverages deep learning to harness
the scale and diversity of satellite imagery across sensors and regions. While
recent foundation models have demonstrated promising generalization across EO
tasks, many remain limited by the scale, geographical coverage, and spectral
diversity of their training data, factors critical for learning globally
transferable representations. In this work, we introduce TerraFM, a scalable
self-supervised learning model that leverages globally distributed Sentinel-1
and Sentinel-2 imagery, combined with large spatial tiles and land-cover aware
sampling to enrich spatial and semantic coverage. By treating sensing
modalities as natural augmentations in our self-supervised approach, we unify
radar and optical inputs via modality-specific patch embeddings and adaptive
cross-attention fusion. Our training strategy integrates local-global
contrastive learning and introduces a dual-centering mechanism that
incorporates class-frequency-aware regularization to address long-tailed
distributions in land cover.TerraFM achieves strong generalization on both
classification and segmentation tasks, outperforming prior models on GEO-Bench
and Copernicus-Bench. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态大模型在图像伪造检测中的即用能力。

Method: 使用三种提示策略（零样本、少样本、思维链）在CASIA v2.0数据集上评估GPT-4V。

Result: 模型能结合低级视觉伪影和上下文知识检测伪造，但不及专用模型。

Conclusion: GPT-4V的通用性和推理能力使其成为图像取证的有潜力的工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V are capable of reasoning
across text and image modalities, showing promise in a variety of complex
vision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the
out-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics,
specifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any
task-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies:
Zero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a
curated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.
  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in
zero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the
most balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative
analysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual
artifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object
scale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible
composites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing
detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic
reasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics.

Motivation: CO$_2$ 排放是环境监测和工业过程的重要指标，尤其是在畜牧业管理中。现有方法需要更高效、更准确的解决方案来实时监测和量化排放。

Method: 结合多尺度上下文聚合网络、UPerHead 和辅助 FCN 组件的语义分割框架，并提出了两个新数据集（CCR 和 RTA）。

Result: CarboNeXT 在 CCR 和 RTA 数据集上的 mIoU 分别达到 88.46% 和 92.95%，实时性能为 60.95 FPS。轻量级变体 CarboFormer 在资源受限设备上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究为环境感知和精准畜牧业管理提供了高效工具，尤其是在实时监测 CO$_2$ 排放方面。

Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions are critical indicators of both
environmental impact and various industrial processes, including livestock
management. We introduce CarboNeXT, a semantic segmentation framework for
Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions
across diverse applications. Our approach integrates a multi-scale context
aggregation network with UPerHead and auxiliary FCN components to effectively
model both local details and global relationships in gas plume imagery. We
contribute two novel datasets: (1) the Controlled Carbon Dioxide Release (CCR)
dataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates
(10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions
from dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CarboNeXT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
88.46% mIoU on CCR and 92.95% mIoU on RTA, with particular effectiveness in
challenging low-flow scenarios. The model operates at 60.95 FPS, enabling
real-time monitoring applications. Additionally, we propose CarboFormer, a
lightweight variant with only 5.07M parameters that achieves 84.68 FPS, with
competitive performance of 84.88% mIoU on CCR and 92.98% on RTA, making it
suitable for resource-constrained platforms such as programmable drones. Our
work advances both environmental sensing and precision livestock management by
providing robust tools for CO$_2$ emission analysis, with a specific focus on
livestock applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学（ST）在结合组织学成像和基因表达谱方面具有潜力，但当前方法因低通量和实验设施限制而受限。现有预测方法未能有效建模细胞间相互作用且内存效率低。

Method: STFlow采用流匹配生成模型，建模全幻灯片基因表达的联合分布，同时使用高效编码器和局部空间注意力处理大规模数据。

Result: 在HEST-1k和STImage-1K4M基准测试中，STFlow显著优于现有基线方法，相对病理学基础模型提升超18%。

Conclusion: STFlow通过高效建模细胞间相互作用和优化内存使用，提升了空间转录组数据的预测性能。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as a powerful technology for
bridging histology imaging with gene expression profiling. However, its
application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized
experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide
histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major
limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they
factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene
expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with
memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in
typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative
model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution
of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level
encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without
excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M
benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.

Motivation: 传统方法需要额外传输信息以实现可扩展性，而现有扩散方法虽避免此问题，但因单一种子导致图像质量不佳。需要一种更高效的种子选择方法。

Method: 提出一种种子选择方法，从多个候选种子中选出最优种子，利用反向扩散早期步骤的中间输出来降低计算成本。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多项指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过优化种子选择，可以在不增加比特率的情况下显著提升图像质量。

Abstract: Conventional methods for scalable image coding for humans and machines
require the transmission of additional information to achieve scalability. A
recent diffusion-based method avoids this by generating human-oriented images
from machine-oriented images without extra bitrate. This method, however, uses
a single random seed, which may lead to suboptimal image quality. In this
paper, we propose a seed selection method that identifies the optimal seed from
multiple candidates to improve image quality without increasing the bitrate. To
reduce computational cost, the selection is performed based on intermediate
outputs obtained from early steps of the reverse diffusion process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在生成多样化的立体图像场景中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based approach to generate stereo
images given a text prompt. Since stereo image datasets with large baselines
are scarce, training a diffusion model from scratch is not feasible. Therefore,
we propose leveraging the strong priors learned by Stable Diffusion and
fine-tuning it on stereo image datasets to adapt it to the task of stereo
generation. To improve stereo consistency and text-to-image alignment, we
further tune the model using prompt alignment and our proposed stereo
consistency reward functions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our approach in generating high-quality stereo images across
diverse scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have opened the door to new research
perspectives in the domain of art and cultural heritage, where a large number
of artifacts have been digitized. There is a need for innovation to ease the
access and highlight the content of digital collections. Such innovations
develop into creative explorations of the digital image in relation to its
malleability and contemporary interpretation, in confrontation to the original
historical object. Based on the concept of the autonomous image, we propose a
new framework towards the production of self-explaining cultural artifacts
using open-source large-language, face detection, text-to-speech and
audio-to-animation models. The goal is to start from a digitized artwork and to
automatically assemble a short video of the latter where the main character
animates to explain its content. The whole process questions cultural biases
encapsulated in large-language models, the potential of digital images and
deepfakes of artworks for educational purposes, along with concerns of the
field of art history regarding such creative diversions.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation is critical for optimal policy design in dynamic
systems. However, obtaining true system states is often impractical or
infeasible, complicating the policy learning process. This paper introduces a
novel neural architecture that integrates spatial feature extraction using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and temporal modeling through gated
recurrent units (GRUs), enabling effective state representation from sequences
of images and corresponding actions. These learned state representations are
used to train a reinforcement learning agent with a Deep Q-Network (DQN).
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach enables real-time,
accurate estimation and control without direct access to ground-truth states.
Additionally, we provide a quantitative evaluation methodology for assessing
the accuracy of the learned states, highlighting their impact on policy
performance and control stability.

Result: 提出一个用户可用的检测平台，为刑事取证提供技术支持。

Conclusion: 该研究能够有效帮助识别伪造内容，揭露犯罪证据。

Abstract: Rapid spread of false images and videos on online platforms is an emerging
problem. Anyone may add, delete, clone or modify people and entities from an
image using various editing software which are readily available. This
generates false and misleading proof to hide the crime. Now-a-days, these false
and counterfeit images and videos are flooding on the internet. These spread
false information. Many methods are available in literature for detecting those
counterfeit contents but new methods of counterfeiting are also evolving.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are observed to be one effective method
as it modifies the context and definition of images producing plausible results
via image-to-image translation. This work uses an independent discriminant
network that can identify GAN generated image or video. A discriminant network
has been created using a convolutional neural network based on
InceptionResNetV2. The article also proposes a platform where users can detect
forged images and videos. This proposed work has the potential to help the
forensics domain to detect counterfeit videos and hidden criminal evidence

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are one of the most revolutionary inventions
of 21st century. At the core of a UAV lies the central processing system that
uses wireless signals to control their movement. The most popular UAVs are
quadcopters that use a set of four motors, arranged as two on either side with
opposite spin. An autonomous UAV is called a drone. Drones have been in service
in the US army since the 90's for covert missions critical to national
security. It would not be wrong to claim that drones make up an integral part
of the national security and provide the most valuable service during
surveillance operations. While UAVs are controlled using wireless signals,
there reside some challenges that disrupt the operation of such vehicles such
as signal quality and range, real time processing, human expertise, robust
hardware and data security. These challenges can be solved by programming UAVs
to be autonomous, using object detection and tracking, through Computer Vision
algorithms. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that seeks the use of
deep learning to gain a high-level understanding of digital images and videos
for the purpose of automating the task of human visual system. Using computer
vision, algorithms for detecting and tracking various objects can be developed
suitable to the hardware so as to allow real time processing for immediate
judgement. This paper attempts to review the various approaches several authors
have proposed for the purpose of autonomous navigation of UAVs by through
various algorithms of object detection and tracking in real time, for the
purpose of applications in various fields such as disaster management, dense
area exploration, traffic vehicle surveillance etc.

### [421] [Can Vision Transformers with ResNet's Global Features Fairly Authenticate Demographic Faces?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05383)
*Abu Sufian,Marco Leo,Cosimo Distante,Anirudha Ghosh,Debaditya Barman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何利用Vision Transformer (ViT)和ResNet预训练的全局特征来实现公平的人脸认证，提出了一种新的少样本原型网络，并在多样化的数据集上测试了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人脸生物识别在不同人口群体中的公平性和泛化性问题。

Method: 结合ViT和ResNet的全局特征，提出少样本原型网络，并在支持集和查询集上进行测试。

Result: Microsoft Swin Transformer在三种ViT中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 预训练的全局特征和少样本学习可以提升跨群体人脸识别的公平性和性能。

Abstract: Biometric face authentication is crucial in computer vision, but ensuring
fairness and generalization across demographic groups remains a big challenge.
Therefore, we investigated whether Vision Transformer (ViT) and ResNet,
leveraging pre-trained global features, can fairly authenticate different
demographic faces while relying minimally on local features. In this
investigation, we used three pre-trained state-of-the-art (SOTA) ViT foundation
models from Facebook, Google, and Microsoft for global features as well as
ResNet-18. We concatenated the features from ViT and ResNet, passed them
through two fully connected layers, and trained on customized face image
datasets to capture the local features. Then, we designed a novel few-shot
prototype network with backbone features embedding. We also developed new
demographic face image support and query datasets for this empirical study. The
network's testing was conducted on this dataset in one-shot, three-shot, and
five-shot scenarios to assess how performance improves as the size of the
support set increases. We observed results across datasets with varying
races/ethnicities, genders, and age groups. The Microsoft Swin Transformer
backbone performed better among the three SOTA ViT for this task. The code and
data are available at: https://github.com/Sufianlab/FairVitBio.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的两阶段训练框架Q-Ponder，通过冷启动和强化学习微调阶段，解决多模态大语言模型在视觉质量评估中评分与可解释性分离的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将质量评分和推理描述作为分离任务优化，导致模型在评分或解释性上存在权衡，限制了多模态大语言模型在视觉质量评估中的潜力。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：冷启动阶段通过专家设计的提示从教师模型提取数据，初始化推理能力；强化学习阶段引入新奖励和GRPO联合优化评分准确性和推理一致性。

Result: Q-Ponder在质量评分回归基准上达到SOTA性能，跨域数据集SRCC提升6.5%，且在描述准确性和合理性上显著优于基于描述的SOTA模型。

Conclusion: Q-Ponder框架有效统一了评分和解释性任务，展示了在多任务上的泛化潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can
proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments.
However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning
descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading
to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with
precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability.
This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality
assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing.
To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a
cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage.
Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher
model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via
cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize
scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived
from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show
that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score
regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain
datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based
SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in
description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization
potential over diverse tasks.

*Mert Can Cakmak,Nitin Agarwal,Diwash Poudel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriPSS是一种新型三模态框架，通过整合颜色特征、深度结构嵌入和语义上下文，实现了高效的视频关键帧提取，并在性能上超越了传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频关键帧提取对视频摘要和检索至关重要，但目前方法难以全面捕捉视频内容的丰富性。

Method: TriPSS结合CIELAB颜色特征、ResNet-50深度嵌入和Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct生成的语义上下文，使用PCA融合多模态数据，并通过HDBSCAN聚类和后续优化提取关键帧。

Result: 在TVSum20和SumMe数据集上，TriPSS表现优于传统单模态和多模态方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: TriPSS能够捕捉丰富的视觉和语义信息，为大规模视频检索场景设立了新的基准。

Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for effective video summarization
and retrieval, yet capturing the complete richness of video content remains
challenging. In this work, we present TriPSS, a novel tri-modal framework that
effectively integrates perceptual cues from color features in the CIELAB space,
deep structural embeddings derived from ResNet-50, and semantic context from
frame-level captions generated by Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. By fusing
these diverse modalities using principal component analysis, TriPSS constructs
robust multi-modal embeddings that enable adaptive segmentation of video
content via HDBSCAN clustering. A subsequent refinement stage incorporating
quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures that the final keyframe set
is both concise and semantically rich. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets TVSum20 and SumMe demonstrate that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art
performance, substantially outperforming traditional unimodal and previous
multi-modal methods. These results underscore TriPSS's ability to capture
nuanced visual and semantic information, thereby setting a new benchmark for
video content understanding in large-scale retrieval scenarios.

*Luka Vetoshkin,Dmitry Yudin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Talk2SAM通过结合文本指导改进复杂形状物体的分割，显著优于SAM-HQ，并支持用户可控的分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割模型（如SAM和SAM-HQ）在分割复杂形状物体（如细线、自行车等）时表现不佳，尤其是对薄结构和精细边界的处理能力不足。

Method: Talk2SAM利用用户提供的文本提示生成CLIP嵌入，将其投影到DINO特征空间，作为SAM-HQ的额外提示，以增强对目标对象的分割能力。

Result: 在BIG、ThinObject5K和DIS5K三个基准测试中，Talk2SAM显著优于SAM-HQ，IoU和边界IoU分别提升了5.9%和8.3%。

Conclusion: 结合自然语言指导是一种灵活且有效的方法，能够在传统基于提示的方法失效时实现精确的对象分割。

Abstract: Segmenting objects with complex shapes, such as wires, bicycles, or
structural grids, remains a significant challenge for current segmentation
models, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its high-quality variant
SAM-HQ. These models often struggle with thin structures and fine boundaries,
leading to poor segmentation quality. We propose Talk2SAM, a novel approach
that integrates textual guidance to improve segmentation of such challenging
objects. The method uses CLIP-based embeddings derived from user-provided text
prompts to identify relevant semantic regions, which are then projected into
the DINO feature space. These features serve as additional prompts for SAM-HQ,
enhancing its ability to focus on the target object. Beyond improving
segmentation accuracy, Talk2SAM allows user-controllable segmentation, enabling
disambiguation of objects within a single bounding box based on textual input.
We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks: BIG, ThinObject5K, and DIS5K.
Talk2SAM consistently outperforms SAM-HQ, achieving up to +5.9\% IoU and +8.3\%
boundary IoU improvements. Our results demonstrate that incorporating natural
language guidance provides a flexible and effective means for precise object
segmentation, particularly in cases where traditional prompt-based methods
fail. The source code is available on GitHub:

Abstract: Image captioning involves generating textual descriptions from input images,
bridging the gap between computer vision and natural language processing.
Recent advancements in transformer-based models have significantly improved
caption generation by leveraging attention mechanisms for better scene
understanding. While various surveys have explored deep learning-based
approaches for image captioning, few have comprehensively analyzed
attention-based transformer models across multiple languages. This survey
reviews attention-based image captioning models, categorizing them into
transformer-based, deep learning-based, and hybrid approaches. It explores
benchmark datasets, discusses evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr,
and ROUGE, and highlights challenges in multilingual captioning. Additionally,
this paper identifies key limitations in current models, including semantic
inconsistencies, data scarcity in non-English languages, and limitations in
reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions, such as
multimodal learning, real-time applications in AI-powered assistants,
healthcare, and forensic analysis. This survey serves as a comprehensive
reference for researchers aiming to advance the field of attention-based image
captioning.

TL;DR: AD-EE是一个早期退出框架，通过结合自动驾驶领域特征和因果推断技术，显著降低延迟并提高目标检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中的视觉语言模型（VLMs）因高延迟和计算开销而影响实时性能，特别是在置信预测后仍继续处理不必要的层级时更明显。

Method: 提出AD-EE框架，利用因果推断确定最佳退出层级，优化VLMs在自动驾驶场景中的推理效率。

Result: 在Waymo和CODA数据集及实际车辆测试中，AD-EE将延迟最大降低57.58%，目标检测准确性最高提升44%。

Conclusion: AD-EE为自动驾驶中VLMs的实时应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly
common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency
and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical
driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit
over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident
predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE,
an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous
driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We
evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets,
including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle
running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple
VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum
improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy,
with maximum gains of up to 44%.

Abstract: In robot scientific laboratories, visual anomaly detection is important for
the timely identification and resolution of potential faults or deviations. It
has become a key factor in ensuring the stability and safety of experimental
processes. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a VLM-based visual
reasoning approach that supports different levels of supervision through four
progressively informative prompt configurations. To systematically evaluate its
effectiveness, we construct a visual benchmark tailored for process anomaly
detection in scientific workflows. Experiments on two representative
vision-language models show that detection accuracy improves as more contextual
information is provided, confirming the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed reasoning approach for process anomaly detection in scientific
workflows. Furthermore, real-world validations at selected experimental steps
confirm that first-person visual observation can effectively identify
process-level anomalies. This work provides both a data-driven foundation and
an evaluation framework for vision anomaly detection in scientific experiment
workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ODIS提出了一种基于对象级自蒸馏的视觉预训练方法，解决了传统图像级自蒸馏在多对象场景中的局限性，显著提升了视觉表征能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉预训练方法假设每张图像仅包含单个对象，而现实场景中图像常含多个对象。这限制了预训练方法在复杂场景数据集中的扩展性。

Method: ODIS通过对象感知裁剪和掩码注意力机制，将自蒸馏粒度从整体图像转移到单个对象，从而简化任务并提升表征质量。

Result: ODIS在ViT-Large上实现了82.6%的ImageNet1k k-NN准确率，显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 对象级自蒸馏为复杂场景中的视觉预训练提供了更高效的解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level
self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly
assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always
hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits
scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity.
We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation
(ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity
from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked
attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer
toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level
task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves
visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at
inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on
ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

TL;DR: 研究评估了111个视觉语言模型（VLM）在视线推断任务中的表现，发现94个模型表现不如随机猜测，而人类表现接近完美。少数表现较好的VLM受任务难度影响，但不受提示和场景对象影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLM在视线推断任务中的表现，以评估其是否具备自然与人类互动的能力。

Method: 通过控制实验比较111个VLM与65名人类参与者在不同难度和变异的照片中的表现，并使用混合效应模型分析行为。

Result: 大多数VLM表现不佳，但少数表现较好的VLM受任务难度影响较小，表现出一定的稳健性。

Conclusion: 目前VLM缺乏视线推断能力，无法自然与人类互动，但仍具备潜力。

Abstract: Gaze-referential inference--the ability to infer what others are looking
at--is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI
interaction. In a controlled study, we evaluated this skill across 111 Vision
Language Models (VLMs) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and
variability, comparing performance with that of human participants (N = 65),
and analyzed behaviors using mixed-effects models. We found that 94 of the 111
VLMs failed to do better than random guessing, while humans achieved
near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs even respond with each choice almost equally
frequently. Are they randomly guessing? Although most VLMs struggle, when we
zoom in on five of the top-tier VLMs with above-chance performance, we find
that their performance declined with increasing task difficulty but varied only
slightly across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral features
cannot be explained by considering them as random guessers. Instead, they
likely use a combination of heuristics and guessing such that their performance
is subject to the task difficulty but robust to perceptual variations. This
suggests that VLMs, lacking gaze inference capability, have yet to become
technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential
remains.

Result: SAVVY显著提升了AV-LLMs的性能，为动态3D空间推理设立了新标准。

Conclusion: SAVVY-Bench和SAVVY方法填补了动态3D空间推理的研究空白，为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone
of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual
Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on
static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D
spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio.
SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and
moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D
localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose
SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages:
(i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as
other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to
the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map
Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and
converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a
final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the
global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a
new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

Motivation: STEP格式需要CAD内核读取和处理，限制了其在大规模学习流程中的应用，尤其是计算集群上的部署。

Method: 提出了一种基于HDF5的开放格式，并开发了一个Python库，支持查询和处理这些文件，同时提供采样、法线和曲率等标准功能。

Result: 通过将Fusion 360和ABC数据集转换为新格式，并在四个标准用例中测试，验证了数据的完整性和合规性。

Conclusion: 新格式有效解决了STEP格式在部署和学习流程中的限制，为大规模CAD数据处理提供了可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) generated from computer-aided design (CAD) is
widely used in industry, with several large datasets available. However, the
data in these datasets is represented in STEP format, requiring a CAD kernel to
read and process it. This dramatically limits their scope and usage in large
learning pipelines, as it constrains the possibility of deploying them on
computing clusters due to the high cost of per-node licenses.
  This paper introduces an alternative format based on the open, cross-platform
format HDF5 and a corresponding dataset for STEP files, paired with an
open-source library to query and process them. Our Python package also provides
standard functionalities such as sampling, normals, and curvature to ease
integration in existing pipelines.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our format, we converted the Fusion 360
dataset and the ABC dataset. We developed four standard use cases (normal
estimation, denoising, surface reconstruction, and segmentation) to assess the
integrity of the data and its compliance with the original STEP files.

Motivation: 视觉强化学习中，图像观察常包含无关干扰（如阴影、云、光线），影响特征提取效率，尤其在训练中未暴露这些干扰时。

Method: 设计SPD方法，利用强弱数据增强并行学习，通过预测双向增强版本间的逆向和前向转移来提取任务相关特征。

Conclusion: SPD方法有效提取任务相关特征，提升对未见观察的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Vision-based reinforcement learning requires efficient and robust
representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain
distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It
becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training.
We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant
features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak
and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting
inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set
of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD
outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly
improves the generalization performance for unseen observations. Our code is

Result: 在DeepMind Control suite和Robosuite的测试中，Dr. G分别比现有方法性能提升117%和14%。

Conclusion: Dr. G能有效提升MBRL在视觉干扰下的泛化能力，且代码已开源。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been used to efficiently solve
vision-based control tasks in highdimensional image observations. Although
recent MBRL algorithms perform well in trained observations, they fail when
faced with visual distractions in observations. These task-irrelevant
distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows, and light) may be constantly present in
real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised method,
Dream to Generalize (Dr. G), for zero-shot MBRL. Dr. G trains its encoder and
world model with dual contrastive learning which efficiently captures
task-relevant features among multi-view data augmentations. We also introduce a
recurrent state inverse dynamics model that helps the world model to better
understand the temporal structure. The proposed methods can enhance the
robustness of the world model against visual distractions. To evaluate the
generalization performance, we first train Dr. G on simple backgrounds and then
test it on complex natural video backgrounds in the DeepMind Control suite, and
the randomizing environments in Robosuite. Dr. G yields a performance
improvement of 117% and 14% over prior works, respectively. Our code is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RF-based MPPE方法中预处理复杂或准确性低的问题。

Result: 在PCKh@0.5指标上性能提升15%，尤其在多人或复杂环境下表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和效率上优于现有技术，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: In the field of Multi-Person Pose Estimation (MPPE), Radio Frequency
(RF)-based methods can operate effectively regardless of lighting conditions
and obscured line-of-sight situations. Existing RF-based MPPE methods typically
involve either 1) converting RF signals into heatmap images through complex
preprocessing, or 2) applying a deep embedding network directly to raw RF
signals. The first approach, while delivering decent performance, is
computationally intensive and time-consuming. The second method, though simpler
in preprocessing, results in lower MPPE accuracy and generalization
performance. This paper proposes an efficient and lightweight one-stage MPPE
model based on raw RF signals. By sub-grouping RF signals and embedding them
using a shared single-layer CNN followed by multi-head attention, this model
outperforms previous methods that embed all signals at once through a large and
deep CNN. Additionally, we propose a new self-supervised learning (SSL) method
that takes inputs from both one unmasked subgroup and the remaining masked
subgroups to predict the latent representations of the masked data. Empirical
results demonstrate that our model improves MPPE accuracy by up to 15 in
PCKh@0.5 compared to previous methods using raw RF signals. Especially, the
proposed SSL method has shown to significantly enhance performance improvements
when placed in new locations or in front of obstacles at RF antennas,
contributing to greater performance gains as the number of people increases.

Conclusion: SIV-Bench为开发更具社交智能的AI提供了关键见解，并确认了转录对话在理解复杂社交互动中的重要性。

Abstract: The rich and multifaceted nature of human social interaction, encompassing
multimodal cues, unobservable relations and mental states, and dynamical
behavior, presents a formidable challenge for artificial intelligence. To
advance research in this area, we introduce SIV-Bench, a novel video benchmark
for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) across Social Scene Understanding (SSU), Social State Reasoning (SSR),
and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP). SIV-Bench features 2,792 video clips and
8,792 meticulously generated question-answer pairs derived from a human-LLM
collaborative pipeline. It is originally collected from TikTok and YouTube,
covering a wide range of video genres, presentation styles, and linguistic and
cultural backgrounds. It also includes a dedicated setup for analyzing the
impact of different textual cues-original on-screen text, added dialogue, or no
text. Our comprehensive experiments on leading MLLMs reveal that while models
adeptly handle SSU, they significantly struggle with SSR and SDP, where
Relation Inference (RI) is an acute bottleneck, as further examined in our
analysis. Our study also confirms the critical role of transcribed dialogue in
aiding comprehension of complex social interactions. By systematically
identifying current MLLMs' strengths and limitations, SIV-Bench offers crucial
insights to steer the development of more socially intelligent AI. The dataset
and code are available at https://kfq20.github.io/sivbench/.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的对抗攻击策略，通过训练一个通用代理模型来生成图像和文本的联合表示，进而对视觉-语言模型进行多模态攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答等任务中表现优异，但其在面对微小扰动时的鲁棒性不足，跨模态依赖性更增加了评估难度。

Method: 训练一个通用代理模型，接受图像和文本输入，生成联合表示，并用于生成图像和文本的多模态对抗扰动。

Result: 该方法在多模态攻击中表现优越，成功削弱了几种最先进的预训练多模态模型（如instruct-BLIP和ViLT）的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多模态对抗攻击策略为评估视觉-语言模型的鲁棒性提供了新的思路，显示出显著的效果。

Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language
processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks
such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to
traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a
challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating
the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and
language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we
train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and
generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial
perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack
strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning
datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results
indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and
single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate
their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art
pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.

Motivation: 视频分类模型因其时间维度增加了复杂性和计算成本，评估其鲁棒性具有挑战性，尤其是在生成微小扰动以诱导误分类方面。

Method: 采用多智能体强化学习方法（包括空间和时间智能体），协作识别视频的敏感区域，利用时间连贯性生成细微扰动。

Conclusion: 该方法在攻击效果和视觉不可感知性上表现优越，为视频分类模型的鲁棒性评估提供了更灵活的工具。

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging,
specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal
dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational
cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to
induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify
the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider
temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more
effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method
enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant
to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action
recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

Motivation: 研究CLIP视觉编码器的局限性是否被VLMs中的强大语言模型弥补，探讨视觉与语言在模型中的分工。

Method: 使用三种基于CLIP的VLMs，通过自注意力机制消融实验，在设计的探测任务中分析视觉表示的作用。

Result: CLIP视觉表示本身提供语义信息，语言解码器能在视觉特征不足时显著补偿性能。

Conclusion: VLMs中存在动态分工，未来设计可让语言解码器承担更多视觉处理任务，从而简化模型架构。

Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of
multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have
various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language
backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by
contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform
controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our
findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer
ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in
scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the
language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover
performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates
future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language
decoder.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLM评估方法成本高、易泄露信息且无法明确失败原因，需要更可控和可解释的评估手段。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now sufficiently advanced to support a
broad range of applications, including answering complex visual questions, and
are increasingly expected to interact with images in varied ways. To evaluate
them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading
charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However,
such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do
not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception,
reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology,
inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of
synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal
perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with
gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number
of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant.
This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure
analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and
interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities. Our code is available at

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to end-to-end
autonomous driving due to their human-like reasoning capabilities. However,
troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving
applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely
formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce
redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs
hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this
paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which
is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured
representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with
0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and
unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands
structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving
decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive
achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20%
accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive
parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally,
ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g.,
weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance
on decision-making tasks in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote
sensing applications, particularly water body detection. However, deep
learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence
speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this
type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on
two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically,
we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining
the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that
mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore,
cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased
stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR
image segmentation.

Abstract: Image degradation is a prevalent issue in various real-world applications,
affecting visual quality and downstream processing tasks. In this study, we
propose a novel framework that employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to
automatically classify degraded images into predefined categories. The VLM
categorizes an input image into one of four degradation types: (A)
super-resolution degradation (including noise, blur, and JPEG compression), (B)
reflection artifacts, (C) motion blur, or (D) no visible degradation
(high-quality image). Once classified, images assigned to categories A, B, or C
undergo targeted restoration using dedicated models tailored for each specific
degradation type. The final output is a restored image with improved visual
quality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
accurately classifying image degradations and enhancing image quality through
specialized restoration models. Our method presents a scalable and automated
solution for real-world image enhancement tasks, leveraging the capabilities of
VLMs in conjunction with state-of-the-art restoration techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型的发展，图像编辑质量提升，但也带来了滥用风险，因此需要可靠的方法来识别图像中的编辑区域。

Result: RADAR在已知和未知扩散模型编辑的图像检测中优于现有技术。

Conclusion: RADAR通过BBC-PAIR基准测试验证，展现了优异的性能，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Changing facial expressions, gestures, or background details may dramatically
alter the meaning conveyed by an image. Notably, recent advances in diffusion
models greatly improve the quality of image manipulation while also opening the
door to misuse. Identifying changes made to authentic images, thus, becomes an
important task, constantly challenged by new diffusion-based editing tools. To
this end, we propose a novel approach for ReliAble iDentification of inpainted
AReas (RADAR). RADAR builds on existing foundation models and combines features
from different image modalities. It also incorporates an auxiliary contrastive
loss that helps to isolate manipulated image patches. We demonstrate these
techniques to significantly improve both the accuracy of our method and its
generalisation to a large number of diffusion models. To support realistic
evaluation, we further introduce BBC-PAIR, a new comprehensive benchmark, with
images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Our experiments show that RADAR
achieves excellent results, outperforming the state-of-the-art in detecting and
localising image edits made by both seen and unseen diffusion models. Our code,

Motivation: 当前3D占用预测方法依赖密集体素或高斯表示，速度慢且缺乏灵活性。

Method: 使用一组紧凑的3D查询表示场景，并通过时间传播和解码为语义高斯。结合去噪渲染目标优化查询。

Result: 在nuScenes和KITTI基准上达到最佳性能，IoU提升1.5，推理速度提升5.9倍。

Conclusion: S2GO证明了稀疏查询表示的优越性，适用于动态场景的实时处理。

Abstract: Despite the demonstrated efficiency and performance of sparse query-based
representations for perception, state-of-the-art 3D occupancy prediction
methods still rely on voxel-based or dense Gaussian-based 3D representations.
However, dense representations are slow, and they lack flexibility in capturing
the temporal dynamics of driving scenes. Distinct from prior work, we instead
summarize the scene into a compact set of 3D queries which are propagated
through time in an online, streaming fashion. These queries are then decoded
into semantic Gaussians at each timestep. We couple our framework with a
denoising rendering objective to guide the queries and their constituent
Gaussians in effectively capturing scene geometry. Owing to its efficient,
query-based representation, S2GO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
nuScenes and KITTI occupancy benchmarks, outperforming prior art (e.g.,
GaussianWorld) by 1.5 IoU with 5.9x faster inference.

Abstract: Removing reflections is a crucial task in computer vision, with significant
applications in photography and image enhancement. Nevertheless, existing
methods are constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and
diverse datasets. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark for Single Image
Reflection Removal (SIRR). We have developed a large-scale dataset containing
5,300 high-quality, pixel-aligned image pairs, each consisting of a reflection
image and its corresponding clean version. Specifically, the dataset is divided
into two parts: 5,000 images are used for training, and 300 images are used for
validation. Additionally, we have included 100 real-world testing images
without ground truth (GT) to further evaluate the practical performance of
reflection removal methods. All image pairs are precisely aligned at the pixel
level to guarantee accurate supervision. The dataset encompasses a broad
spectrum of real-world scenarios, featuring various lighting conditions, object
types, and reflection patterns, and is segmented into training, validation, and
test sets to facilitate thorough evaluation. To validate the usefulness of our
dataset, we train a U-Net-based model and evaluate it using five widely-used
metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS, and NIQE. We will release both the
dataset and the code on https://github.com/caijie0620/OpenRR-5k to facilitate

Abstract: Visual attention is a mechanism closely intertwined with vision and memory.
Top-down information influences visual processing through attention. We
designed a neural network model inspired by aspects of human visual attention.
This model consists of two networks: one serves as a basic processor performing
a simple task, while the other processes contextual information and guides the
first network through attention to adapt to more complex tasks. After training
the model and visualizing the learned attention response, we discovered that
the model's emergent attention patterns corresponded to spatial and
feature-based attention. This similarity between human visual attention and
attention in computer vision suggests a promising direction for studying human

Conclusion: VR-INR在灵活性和性能上均优于现有方法，展示了隐式神经表示在视频修复中的潜力。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) videos play a crucial role in many computer vision
applications. Although existing video restoration (VR) methods can
significantly enhance video quality by exploiting temporal information across
video frames, they are typically trained for fixed upscaling factors and lack
the flexibility to handle scales or degradations beyond their training
distribution. In this paper, we introduce VR-INR, a novel video restoration
approach based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that is trained only
on a single upscaling factor ($\times 4$) but generalizes effectively to
arbitrary, unseen super-resolution scales at test time. Notably, VR-INR also
performs zero-shot denoising on noisy input, despite never having seen noisy
data during training. Our method employs a hierarchical
spatial-temporal-texture encoding framework coupled with multi-resolution
implicit hash encoding, enabling adaptive decoding of high-resolution and
noise-suppressed frames from low-resolution inputs at any desired
magnification. Experimental results show that VR-INR consistently maintains
high-quality reconstructions at unseen scales and noise during training,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in sharpness, detail
preservation, and denoising efficacy.

Motivation: 反射现象会显著降低图像质量，但由于反射的复杂性和多样性，SIRR仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。现有的方法难以有效处理所有情况。

Method: 提出了一种U型架构，结合了快速傅里叶变换（FFT）Transformer块和分层Transformer块。前者利用频率域信息捕捉反射模式，后者通过多尺度特征提取处理不同大小和复杂度的反射。

Result: 在三个公开测试数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了当前最佳性能。

Conclusion: F2T2-HiT架构通过创新的Transformer设计，有效提升了SIRR任务的性能，解决了复杂反射场景下的难题。

Abstract: Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR) technique plays a crucial role in
image processing by eliminating unwanted reflections from the background. These
reflections, often caused by photographs taken through glass surfaces, can
significantly degrade image quality. SIRR remains a challenging problem due to
the complex and varied reflections encountered in real-world scenarios. These
reflections vary significantly in intensity, shapes, light sources, sizes, and
coverage areas across the image, posing challenges for most existing methods to
effectively handle all cases. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces a U-shaped Fast Fourier Transform Transformer and Hierarchical
Transformer (F2T2-HiT) architecture, an innovative Transformer-based design for
SIRR. Our approach uniquely combines Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Transformer
blocks and Hierarchical Transformer blocks within a UNet framework. The FFT
Transformer blocks leverage the global frequency domain information to
effectively capture and separate reflection patterns, while the Hierarchical
Transformer blocks utilize multi-scale feature extraction to handle reflections
of varying sizes and complexities. Extensive experiments conducted on three
publicly available testing datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance,
validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: FocusDiff 通过关注细粒度语义差异，显著提高了文本到图像生成的精确控制能力。

Abstract: Recent studies extend the autoregression paradigm to text-to-image
generation, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models. However, our
new PairComp benchmark -- featuring test cases of paired prompts with similar
syntax but different fine-grained semantics -- reveals that existing models
struggle with fine-grained text-image alignment thus failing to realize precise
control over visual tokens. To address this, we propose FocusDiff, which
enhances fine-grained text-image semantic alignment by focusing on subtle
differences between similar text-image pairs. We construct a new dataset of
paired texts and images with similar overall expressions but distinct local
semantics, further introducing a novel reinforcement learning algorithm to
emphasize such fine-grained semantic differences for desired image generation.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing text-to-image
benchmarks and significantly outperforms prior methods on PairComp.

Conclusion: MORSE-500提供了一个可扩展、透明的测试环境，推动多模态推理研究的持续进步。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks
for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they
overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal
complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on
mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning
skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal
capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many
benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure
modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal
Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully
scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning
categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic
Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and
curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control
over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling
difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static
benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:
its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily
challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing
next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems --
including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest
available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal
substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large
deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset,
generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent,
reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

TL;DR: YoursProtoP是一种新型交互策略，通过用户监督个性化原型部分，解决了概念不一致性和用户偏好问题，在不影响模型准确性的同时提升解释的可理解性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于概念的可解释神经网络因概念不一致性和缺乏用户个性化反馈机制，导致解释难以理解。

Method: 提出YoursProtoP，通过用户监督调整和拆分原型部分，以适应用户偏好。

Result: 在FunnyBirds、CUB、CARS和PETS数据集上验证了YoursProtoP在保持模型准确性的同时实现概念一致性。

Conclusion: YoursProtoP有效解决了概念不一致性问题，并通过交互机制提升了用户对模型解释的理解。

Abstract: Concept-based interpretable neural networks have gained significant attention
due to their intuitive and easy-to-understand explanations based on case-based
reasoning, such as "this bird looks like those sparrows". However, a major
limitation is that these explanations may not always be comprehensible to users
due to concept inconsistency, where multiple visual features are
inappropriately mixed (e.g., a bird's head and wings treated as a single
concept). This inconsistency breaks the alignment between model reasoning and
human understanding. Furthermore, users have specific preferences for how
concepts should look, yet current approaches provide no mechanism for
incorporating their feedback. To address these issues, we introduce
YoursProtoP, a novel interactive strategy that enables the personalization of
prototypical parts - the visual concepts used by the model - according to user
needs. By incorporating user supervision, YoursProtoP adapts and splits
concepts used for both prediction and explanation to better match the user's
preferences and understanding. Through experiments on both the synthetic
FunnyBirds dataset and a real-world scenario using the CUB, CARS, and PETS
datasets in a comprehensive user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
YoursProtoP in achieving concept consistency without compromising the accuracy
of the model.

TL;DR: FRAME是一种自监督视频帧编码器，专为密集视频理解任务设计，能够生成时空一致的密集特征，优于现有图像和视频编码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编码器（如DINO、CLIP）缺乏时间感知能力，而视频模型（如VideoMAE）在密集预测任务上表现不佳。FRAME旨在填补这一空白。

Method: FRAME通过自监督学习，从过去和当前的RGB帧预测当前和未来的DINO块特征，生成精确且时间一致的表示。

Result: 在七个数据集的六个密集预测任务中，FRAME均优于图像编码器和现有自监督视频模型。

Conclusion: FRAME不仅性能优异，还保持了紧凑架构，适用于多种下游任务，并能与CLIP语义空间对齐，支持语言驱动任务。

Abstract: Dense video prediction tasks, such as object tracking and semantic
segmentation, require video encoders that generate temporally consistent,
spatially dense features for every frame. However, existing approaches fall
short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video
models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense
prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame
encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current
and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to
spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge,
FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense
prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual
correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with
CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video
classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven
datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing
self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a
compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.

Motivation: 当前3D技术在动态现象（如移动物体分割）中效果不佳，尤其是在复杂的动态视频中。论文旨在改进这一局限性。

Method: 提出分层运动融合（Layered Motion Fusion）方法，将2D运动分割预测融合到分层辐射场中，并通过测试时精炼减少数据复杂性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在动态场景分割中显著优于2D基线模型。

Conclusion: 证明了3D技术即使在动态现象的挑战性场景下，也能有效提升2D分析效果。

Abstract: Computer vision is largely based on 2D techniques, with 3D vision still
relegated to a relatively narrow subset of applications. However, by building
on recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors
have shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from
independent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is
particularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is
significant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In
fact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques
are ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in
particular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this
issue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D
by fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered
radiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long,
dynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric
structure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the
(incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time
refinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing
the data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the
refinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that
surpass the 2D baseline by a large margin. This demonstrates that 3D techniques
can enhance 2D analysis even for dynamic phenomena in a challenging and
realistic setting.

Conclusion: 通过分析幻觉原因并设计无需训练的策略，论文成功提升了模型对非语义场景文本的处理能力，为未来研究提供了新思路和基准。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in visual
perception and reasoning. However, when confronted with visually ambiguous or
non-semantic scene text, they often struggle to accurately spot and understand
the content, frequently generating semantically plausible yet visually
incorrect answers, which we refer to as semantic hallucination. In this work,
we investigate the underlying causes of semantic hallucination and identify a
key finding: Transformer layers in LLM with stronger attention focus on scene
text regions are less prone to producing semantic hallucinations. Thus, we
propose a training-free semantic hallucination mitigation framework comprising
two key components: (1) ZoomText, a coarse-to-fine strategy that identifies
potential text regions without external detectors; and (2) Grounded Layer
Correction, which adaptively leverages the internal representations from layers
less prone to hallucination to guide decoding, correcting hallucinated outputs
for non-semantic samples while preserving the semantics of meaningful ones. To
enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of over
1,730 samples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually
curated question-answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates semantic
hallucination but also achieves strong performance on public benchmarks for
scene text spotting and understanding.

Conclusion: EX-4D通过创新的几何表示和训练策略，显著提升了极端视角下视频生成的性能。

Abstract: Generating high-quality camera-controllable videos from monocular input is a
challenging task, particularly under extreme viewpoint. Existing methods often
struggle with geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts in boundaries,
leading to degraded visual quality. In this paper, we introduce EX-4D, a novel
framework that addresses these challenges through a Depth Watertight Mesh
representation. The representation serves as a robust geometric prior by
explicitly modeling both visible and occluded regions, ensuring geometric
consistency in extreme camera pose. To overcome the lack of paired multi-view
datasets, we propose a simulated masking strategy that generates effective
training data only from monocular videos. Additionally, a lightweight
LoRA-based video diffusion adapter is employed to synthesize high-quality,
physically consistent, and temporally coherent videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EX-4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
physical consistency and extreme-view quality, enabling practical 4D video
generation.

Motivation: 现有的3DGS方法在姿态估计和优化上耗时较长，且SLAM方法在大场景和宽基线下表现不佳，需要一种更高效的实时处理方法。

Method: 结合快速初始姿态估计（基于学习特征和GPU友好的小束调整）和直接采样高斯基元位置，通过增量式生成基元加速训练，并引入可扩展的辐射场构建来处理大场景。

Result: 能够即时处理各种拍摄场景和大尺度场景，在速度、图像质量等方面与其他方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法在实时性和可扩展性方面表现优越，适用于多样化的捕捉场景和大尺度场景。

Abstract: Radiance field methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) allow easy
reconstruction from photos, enabling free-viewpoint navigation. Nonetheless,
pose estimation using Structure from Motion and 3DGS optimization can still
each take between minutes and hours of computation after capture is complete.
SLAM methods combined with 3DGS are fast but struggle with wide camera
baselines and large scenes. We present an on-the-fly method to produce camera
poses and a trained 3DGS immediately after capture. Our method can handle dense
and wide-baseline captures of ordered photo sequences and large-scale scenes.
To do this, we first introduce fast initial pose estimation, exploiting learned
features and a GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment. We then introduce direct
sampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning
primitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two
efficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian
primitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing
scalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives,
storing them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives
are progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint.
We evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that our solution
can provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes
we target while remaining competitive with other methods that only handle
specific capture styles or scene sizes in speed, image quality, or both.

Abstract: Recent advancements in camera-based occupancy prediction have focused on the
simultaneous prediction of 3D semantics and scene flow, a task that presents
significant challenges due to specific difficulties, e.g., occlusions and
unbalanced dynamic environments. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and
their underlying causes. To address them, we propose a novel regularization
framework called VoxelSplat. This framework leverages recent developments in 3D
Gaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i) Enhanced
Semantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method
decodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them
onto the 2D camera view. This provides additional supervision signals in the
camera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D
semantics. (ii) Scene Flow Learning: Our framework uses the predicted scene
flow to model the motion of Gaussians, and is thus able to learn the scene flow
of moving objects in a self-supervised manner using the labels of adjacent
frames. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy
models, enhancing performance without increasing inference time. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelSplat
in improving the accuracy of both semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation.

Conclusion: PartCrafter展示了部件感知生成先验在3D理解和合成中的优势，代码和训练数据将公开。

Abstract: We introduce PartCrafter, the first structured 3D generative model that
jointly synthesizes multiple semantically meaningful and geometrically distinct
3D meshes from a single RGB image. Unlike existing methods that either produce
monolithic 3D shapes or follow two-stage pipelines, i.e., first segmenting an
image and then reconstructing each segment, PartCrafter adopts a unified,
compositional generation architecture that does not rely on pre-segmented
inputs. Conditioned on a single image, it simultaneously denoises multiple 3D
parts, enabling end-to-end part-aware generation of both individual objects and
complex multi-object scenes. PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh
diffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained
weights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A
compositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of
disentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables
structured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts,
ensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation.
To support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level
annotations from large-scale 3D object datasets. Experiments show that
PartCrafter outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D
meshes, including parts that are not directly visible in input images,
demonstrating the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding
and synthesis. Code and training data will be released.

Motivation: 解决现实世界中图像因多种退化（如不同拍摄条件、设备和后处理流程）导致的恢复难题，现有方法难以泛化到实际数据。

Method: UniRes框架通过扩散模型结合多个专门模型，利用各自独立的训练数据，实现复杂退化的端到端恢复，并支持灵活的扩展和调整。

Result: 实验表明，UniRes在复杂和单一退化图像恢复任务中均表现优异，尤其在复杂退化情况下显著提升性能。

Conclusion: UniRes为复杂退化图像恢复提供了灵活且高效的解决方案，扩展性强且性能优越。

Abstract: Real-world image restoration is hampered by diverse degradations stemming
from varying capture conditions, capture devices and post-processing pipelines.
Existing works make improvements through simulating those degradations and
leveraging image generative priors, however generalization to in-the-wild data
remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we focus on complex degradations,
i.e., arbitrary mixtures of multiple types of known degradations, which is
frequently seen in the wild. A simple yet flexible diffusionbased framework,
named UniRes, is proposed to address such degradations in an end-to-end manner.
It combines several specialized models during the diffusion sampling steps,
hence transferring the knowledge from several well-isolated restoration tasks
to the restoration of complex in-the-wild degradations. This only requires
well-isolated training data for several degradation types. The framework is
flexible as extensions can be added through a unified formulation, and the
fidelity-quality trade-off can be adjusted through a new paradigm. Our proposed
method is evaluated on both complex-degradation and single-degradation image
restoration datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental
results show consistent performance gain especially for images with complex
degradations.

Method: 提出多任务学习框架，包括：1) 通过参数特定边界分割退化空间的任务定义；2) 基于焦点损失的多任务权重机制量化任务不平衡；3) 自适应数据重平衡策略防止异常样本主导优化。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，该方法在所有退化任务上均表现优异。

Conclusion: 本文方法通过协调任务定义、不平衡量化和数据重平衡，实现了对复杂退化模式的有效处理，提升了Real-SR的性能。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-SR) is a challenging problem due to
the complex degradation patterns in low-resolution images. Unlike approaches
that assume a broadly encompassing degradation space, we focus specifically on
achieving an optimal balance in how SR networks handle different degradation
patterns within a fixed degradation space. We propose an improved paradigm that
frames Real-SR as a data-heterogeneous multi-task learning problem, our work
addresses task imbalance in the paradigm through coordinated advancements in
task definition, imbalance quantification, and adaptive data rebalancing.
Specifically, we introduce a novel task definition framework that segments the
degradation space by setting parameter-specific boundaries for degradation
operators, effectively reducing the task quantity while maintaining task
discrimination. We then develop a focal loss based multi-task weighting
mechanism that precisely quantifies task imbalance dynamics during model
training. Furthermore, to prevent sporadic outlier samples from dominating the
gradient optimization of the shared multi-task SR model, we strategically
convert the quantified task imbalance into controlled data rebalancing through
deliberate regulation of task-specific training volumes. Extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistent
superiority across all degradation tasks.

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于LLM的先验方法对可扩展的开放世界视觉理解具有潜力。

Abstract: Understanding relationships between objects is central to visual
intelligence, with applications in embodied AI, assistive systems, and scene
understanding. Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a
fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key
challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but
unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work
introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by
expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating
candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and
training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence
(maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond
annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally,
we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21
held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed.
Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving
mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on
these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors
for scalable open-world visual understanding.

Conclusion: ADR-MVS通过自适应深度范围和几何感知改进，显著提升了航空影像的多视图立体重建精度。

Abstract: Three-dimensional digital urban reconstruction from multi-view aerial images
is a critical application where deep multi-view stereo (MVS) methods outperform
traditional techniques. However, existing methods commonly overlook the key
differences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth
ranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with
low-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive
Depth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve
multi-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth
range predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal
estimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the
range map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth
boundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating
convergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are
progressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for
precise depth regression. Moreover, a normal-guided cost aggregation operation
is specially devised for aerial stereo images to improve geometric awareness
within the cost volume. Finally, we introduce a normal-guided depth refinement
module that surpasses existing RGB-guided techniques. Experimental results
demonstrate that ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WHU,
LuoJia-MVS, and M\"unchen datasets, while exhibits superior computational
complexity.

Abstract: Extracranial tissues visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may
hold significant value for characterizing health conditions and clinical
decision-making, yet they are rarely quantified. Current tools have not been
widely validated, particularly in settings of developing brains or underlying
pathology. We present TissUnet, a deep learning model that segments skull bone,
subcutaneous fat, and muscle from routine three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI,
with or without contrast enhancement. The model was trained on 155 paired
MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering
a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to
AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice
coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second
validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR:
0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art method. Acceptability testing resulted
in an 89% acceptance rate after adjudication by a tie-breaker(N=108 MRIs), and
TissUnet demonstrated excellent performance in the blinded comparative review
(N=45 MRIs), including both healthy and tumor cases in pediatric populations.
TissUnet enables fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation of extracranial

TL;DR: DriveAction是一个专为VLA模型设计的动作驱动基准，覆盖多样场景并通过树状评估框架链接视觉、语言和动作任务。实验表明，视觉和语言输入对动作预测准确率至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准缺乏场景多样性、可靠的动作级别标注和符合人类偏好的评估协议，DriveAction旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用真实驾驶数据生成16,185个QA对，提供高层次离散动作标签，并设计动作驱动的树状评估框架。

Result: 实验显示，缺少视觉或语言输入分别导致动作预测准确率下降3.3%和4.1%，同时缺失则下降8.0%。

Conclusion: DriveAction为自动驾驶中的人类化决策提供了新见解和严谨基础，支持模型瓶颈的精准识别。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but
existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level
annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. To address
these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark
specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from
2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data
proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to
ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete
action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and
implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that
explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both
comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language
guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3%
without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without
either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks
with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous
foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.

Conclusion: 论文的关键贡献是对标记结构的分析，同时强调了多种子平均结果报告的透明性对领域稳健发展的重要性。

Abstract: Effectively representing 3D scenes for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is crucial yet challenging. Existing approaches commonly only rely on
2D image features and use varied tokenization approaches. This work presents a
rigorous study of 3D token structures, systematically comparing video-based and
point-based representations while maintaining consistent model backbones and
parameters. We propose a novel approach that enriches visual tokens by
incorporating 3D point cloud features from a Sonata pretrained Point
Transformer V3 encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that merging explicit 3D
features significantly boosts performance. Furthermore, we show that
point-based token structures can rival video-based ones when the points are
cleverly sampled and ordered. Our best models from both structures achieve
state-of-the-art results on multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. We emphasize
our analysis of token structures as a key contribution, alongside transparent
reporting of results averaged over multiple seeds, a practice we believe is
vital for robust progress in the field.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MoralCLIP，一种基于道德基础理论的多模态嵌入方法，用于增强AI系统对道德内容的识别与理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在多模态语义理解中缺乏道德维度的解析能力，论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用Social-Moral Image Database构建多标签数据集，通过道德数据增强策略扩展数据，训练MoralCLIP模型实现跨模态道德对齐。

Result: 实验表明，显式的道德监督能提升单模态和多模态对道德内容的理解，为道德感知AI系统奠定基础。

Conclusion: MoralCLIP为增强AI系统的道德认知能力提供了有效方法，未来可应用于更广泛的道德感知任务中。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled rich semantic
understanding across modalities. However, these encoding methods lack the
ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial
aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal
learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT).
Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding
space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the
multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral
foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data
augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs
labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit
moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral
content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of
recognizing and aligning with human moral values.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升计算效率与性能平衡，适用于密集预测任务及推理加速。

Abstract: Vision transformers have been widely explored in various vision tasks. Due to
heavy computational cost, much interest has aroused for compressing vision
transformer dynamically in the aspect of tokens. Current methods mainly pay
attention to token pruning or merging to reduce token numbers, in which tokens
are compressed exclusively, causing great information loss and therefore
post-training is inevitably required to recover the performance. In this paper,
we rethink token reduction and unify the process as an explicit form of token
matrix transformation, in which all existing methods are constructing special
forms of matrices within the framework. Furthermore, we propose a many-to-many
Token Transforming framework that serves as a generalization of all existing
methods and reserves the most information, even enabling training-free
acceleration. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework.
Specifically, we reduce 40% FLOPs and accelerate DeiT-S by $\times$1.5 with
marginal 0.1% accuracy drop. Furthermore, we extend the method to dense
prediction tasks including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation,
and language model generation. Results demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently achieves substantial improvements, offering a better
computation-performance trade-off, impressive budget reduction and inference
acceleration.

Result: 在GAPart数据集上验证了姿态估计能力，并在真实机器人任务中实现了200Hz的实时反馈。

Conclusion: YOEO方法有效提升了实时性和实用性，适用于机器人操作任务。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for
articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown
promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level.
However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that
first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the
Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These
approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in
real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a
single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS
representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate
point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same
part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering
algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances.
Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the
separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size.
Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation
capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our
synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual
feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen
articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our
proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多边形近似中指标选择的问题，研究者希望验证加权优值图是否可以替代Rosin指标。

Method: 通过理论分析、实验验证和统计相关性分析（Pearson相关系数）来比较这两种指标。

Result: 结果表明两种指标理论独立且无统计相关性，无法互相替代。

Conclusion: 加权优值图不能替代Rosin指标用于评估多边形近似方案的优劣。

Abstract: Many studies had been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a
digital boundary by piece straight-line segments for further processing
required in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared
their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the
goodness of a polygonal approximation was figure of merit. Later, it was
pointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason
and this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure
called merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal
approximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness
of an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit
as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An
attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures -
weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be
used instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis,
experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The
mathematical formula for weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are
analyzed and through proof of theorems it is found that the two measures are
independent of each other theoretically. The graphical analysis of experiments
carried out using public dataset supports theoretical analysis. The statistical
analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient also establishes that the two
measures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a
sub-optimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other sub-optimal
scheme as indicated by Rosin's measure then the same conclusion cannot be drawn
using weighted figure of merit and so one cannot use weighted figure of merit
instead of Rosin's measure.

Method: 方法是通过构建一个分类为真实错觉和虚假错觉的VQA数据集，评估LVLMs在区分实际和表象特征时的表现。

Result: 结果表明，尽管LVLMs能正确回答关于两种特征的问题，但它们对真实和虚假错觉问题的回答一致，可能依赖于先验知识而非真正的视觉理解。

Conclusion: 结论是LVLMs的表现可能更多基于对错觉的先验知识，而非实际的视觉认知能力，数据集可用于进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools
for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision
studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision
language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions.
However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished
actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine
cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question
answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along
with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies
between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same
actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar
geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and
fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and
apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to
recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types,
they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA
questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge
of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available

<details>

Motivation: 解决传感器数据因延迟导致的时序不一致问题，以提高自动驾驶感知系统的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 为LiDAR和雷达数据添加相对于相机的时间戳偏移特征；2) 使用数据增强模拟实际部署中的传感器延迟情况。

Result: 实验表明，传统方法在传感器数据延迟时表现显著下降，而本文方法在同步和延迟条件下均表现稳定。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法能有效缓解传感器时间不一致问题，提升了自动驾驶系统的感知性能。

Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in
autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors
arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal
misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state
estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are
critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address
this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar
both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor
fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor
staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into
a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple
LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model
shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach
reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale
conditions.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have gained wide adoption in the virtual human
generation due to their outstanding expressiveness. However, their substantial
computational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time
interactive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration
requirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video
generation framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges.
Firstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the
minimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions,
which significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a
consistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure
real-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization
and pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference
speed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and
model quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for
long-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and
low latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate
class labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking,
listening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for
fine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent
capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
low-latency, fluid, and authentic two-way communication. On an NVIDIA RTX
4090D, our model achieves a maximum of 78 FPS at a resolution of 384x384 and 45
FPS at a resolution of 512x512, with an initial video generation latency of 140
ms and 215 ms, respectively.

Abstract: In the field of 3D medical imaging, accurately extracting and representing
the blood vessels with curvilinear structures holds paramount importance for
clinical diagnosis. Previous methods have commonly relied on discrete
representation like mask, often resulting in local fractures or scattered
fragments due to the inherent limitations of the per-pixel classification
paradigm. In this work, we introduce DeformCL, a new continuous representation
based on Deformable Centerlines, where centerline points act as nodes connected
by edges that capture spatial relationships. Compared with previous
representations, DeformCL offers three key advantages: natural connectivity,
noise robustness, and interaction facility. We present a comprehensive training
pipeline structured in a cascaded manner to fully exploit these favorable
properties of DeformCL. Extensive experiments on four 3D vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.
Furthermore, the visualization of curved planar reformation images validates
the clinical significance of the proposed framework. We release the code in

Conclusion: 该方法独立于编解码器架构，适用于各种类似UNet的网络，为医学图像分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet
serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is
the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant
limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different
scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which
constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet
have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations
remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale
feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an
initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By
leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive
ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature
fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures,
making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC,
KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets
demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and
maintained high performance. The code is available at

Abstract: In recent years, there has been rapid development in the field of event
vision. It manifests itself both on the technical side, as better and better
event sensors are available, and on the algorithmic side, as more and more
applications of this technology are proposed and scientific papers are
published. However, the data stream from these sensors typically contains a
significant amount of noise, which varies depending on factors such as the
degree of illumination in the observed scene or the temperature of the sensor.
We propose a hardware architecture of the Distance-based Interpolation with
Frequency Weights (DIF) filter and implement it on an FPGA chip. To evaluate
the algorithm and compare it with other solutions, we have prepared a new
high-resolution event dataset, which we are also releasing to the community.
Our architecture achieved a throughput of 403.39 million events per second
(MEPS) for a sensor resolution of 1280 x 720 and 428.45 MEPS for a resolution
of 640 x 480. The average values of the Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (AUROC) index ranged from 0.844 to 0.999, depending on the
dataset, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art filtering solutions, but
with much higher throughput and better operation over a wide range of noise
levels.

TL;DR: FontAdapter框架通过在参考字形图像的基础上快速生成未见过的字体样式，解决了现有方法在实时定制上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在适应未见过的字体时计算成本高且效率低，难以实现实时定制。

Method: 提出两阶段课程学习方法：先学习从孤立字形提取字体属性，再将这些风格融入多样化自然背景。构建合成数据集以支持训练。

Result: 实验显示FontAdapter无需额外微调即可高质量、稳健地定制未见过的字体，并支持视觉文本编辑和跨语言字体转换。

Conclusion: FontAdapter是一个多功能框架，为字体定制任务提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the seamless
integration of visual text into diverse image contexts. Recent approaches
further improve control over font styles through fine-tuning with predefined
font dictionaries. However, adapting unseen fonts outside the preset is
computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes, making real-time
customization impractical. In this paper, we present FontAdapter, a framework
that enables visual text generation in unseen fonts within seconds, conditioned
on a reference glyph image. To this end, we find that direct training on font
datasets fails to capture nuanced font attributes, limiting generalization to
new glyphs. To overcome this, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning
approach: FontAdapter first learns to extract font attributes from isolated
glyphs and then integrates these styles into diverse natural backgrounds. To
support this two-stage training scheme, we construct synthetic datasets
tailored to each stage, leveraging large-scale online fonts effectively.
Experiments demonstrate that FontAdapter enables high-quality, robust font
customization across unseen fonts without additional fine-tuning during
inference. Furthermore, it supports visual text editing, font style blending,
and cross-lingual font transfer, positioning FontAdapter as a versatile
framework for font customization tasks.

Result: 方法在大规模Ego-Exo4D对象对应基准测试中排名第二。

Conclusion: 所提出的多模态融合和跨视角对齐方法有效提升了对象分割和对应的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this report, we present a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation
approach for the object correspondence task in the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence
Challenges 2025. Given object queries from one perspective (e.g., ego view),
the goal is to predict the corresponding object masks in another perspective
(e.g., exo view). To tackle this task, we propose a multimodal condition fusion
module that enhances object localization by leveraging both visual masks and
textual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the
visual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object
alignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives,
thereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed
method ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object
correspondence benchmark. Code will be made available at

TL;DR: ChronoTailor是一种基于扩散的视频虚拟试穿框架，通过时空注意力机制和特征融合，实现了时间一致性并保留了服装细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视频虚拟试穿中难以保持连续性和还原服装细节，因此提出ChronoTailor框架以解决这些问题。

Method: 利用区域感知空间引导和注意力驱动的时序特征融合机制，结合多尺度服装特征和对齐机制，提升试穿效果。

Result: ChronoTailor在时空连续性和服装细节保留方面显著优于现有方法，并在新数据集StyleDress上验证了其性能。

Conclusion: ChronoTailor通过创新的方法解决了视频虚拟试穿的关键问题，并在实验中表现出色。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly replace the clothing of a person in a
source video with a target garment. Despite significant progress in this field,
existing approaches still struggle to maintain continuity and reproduce garment
details. In this paper, we introduce ChronoTailor, a diffusion-based framework
that generates temporally consistent videos while preserving fine-grained
garment details. By employing a precise spatio-temporal attention mechanism to
guide the integration of fine-grained garment features, ChronoTailor achieves
robust try-on performance. First, ChronoTailor leverages region-aware spatial
guidance to steer the evolution of spatial attention and employs an
attention-driven temporal feature fusion mechanism to generate more continuous
temporal features. This dual approach not only enables fine-grained local
editing but also effectively mitigates artifacts arising from video dynamics.
Second, ChronoTailor integrates multi-scale garment features to preserve
low-level visual details and incorporates a garment-pose feature alignment to
ensure temporal continuity during dynamic motion. Additionally, we collect
StyleDress, a new dataset featuring intricate garments, varied environments,
and diverse poses, offering advantages over existing public datasets, and will
be publicly available for research. Extensive experiments show that
ChronoTailor maintains spatio-temporal continuity and preserves garment details
during motion, significantly outperforming previous methods.

Motivation: 提高皮肤点刺试验（SPT）的准确性和一致性，尤其是在过敏疹块的检测和描绘过程中。

Method: 设计了一种结合神经网络和算法的方法，利用SPAT设备的多光照图像进行像素级分割和疹块检测。

Result: 在217名患者的验证集上，多光照条件下的32张图像比单张传统光照图像的准确性更高。

Conclusion: 多光照条件下的图像显著提升了SPT的准确性，验证了SPAT设备的优越性。

Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing
sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)
device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32
images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which
leads to a diagnosis.
  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected
inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate
wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by
drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT
device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a
custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural
network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an
algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the
wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation
set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted
image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions
offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional,
uniform light.

TL;DR: CryoFastAR是一种几何基础模型，用于从无序的冷冻电镜（cryo-EM）图像中直接预测蛋白质的3D姿态，解决了传统迭代优化方法耗时的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电镜中的无序粒子图像姿态估计和3D重建依赖于耗时的迭代优化，主要由于低信噪比和对比传递函数畸变等挑战。

Method: 通过整合多视角特征并在大规模模拟冷冻电镜数据上训练，结合渐进式训练策略，CryoFastAR提高了姿态估计的准确性和泛化性。

Result: 实验表明，CryoFastAR在合成和真实数据集上实现了与传统方法相当的质量，同时显著加速了推理速度。

Conclusion: CryoFastAR为冷冻电镜中的蛋白质重构提供了一种快速且准确的新方法。

Abstract: Pose estimation from unordered images is fundamental for 3D reconstruction,
robotics, and scientific imaging. Recent geometric foundation models, such as
DUSt3R, enable end-to-end dense 3D reconstruction but remain underexplored in
scientific imaging fields like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for
near-atomic protein reconstruction. In cryo-EM, pose estimation and 3D
reconstruction from unordered particle images still depend on time-consuming
iterative optimization, primarily due to challenges such as low signal-to-noise
ratios (SNR) and distortions from the contrast transfer function (CTF). We
introduce CryoFastAR, the first geometric foundation model that can directly
predict poses from Cryo-EM noisy images for Fast ab initio Reconstruction. By
integrating multi-view features and training on large-scale simulated cryo-EM
data with realistic noise and CTF modulations, CryoFastAR enhances pose
estimation accuracy and generalization. To enhance training stability, we
propose a progressive training strategy that first allows the model to extract
essential features under simpler conditions before gradually increasing
difficulty to improve robustness. Experiments show that CryoFastAR achieves
comparable quality while significantly accelerating inference over traditional
iterative approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的跨域少样本目标检测方法Domain-RAG，通过检索引导的图像生成框架解决现有方法在保持类别一致性和背景对齐方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域少样本目标检测(CD-FSOD)面临生成图像视觉真实性和域对齐的挑战，现有方法难以直接应用。

Method: Domain-RAG采用三阶段框架：域感知背景检索、域引导背景生成及前景-背景合成。

Result: 实验表明，Domain-RAG在多任务中表现优异，显著优于基线方法，并取得新SOTA。

Conclusion: Domain-RAG是一种高效、无需训练的解决方案，显著提升了跨域少样本目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel objects
with only a handful of labeled samples from previously unseen domains. While
data augmentation and generative methods have shown promise in few-shot
learning, their effectiveness for CD-FSOD remains unclear due to the need for
both visual realism and domain alignment. Existing strategies, such as
copy-paste augmentation and text-to-image generation, often fail to preserve
the correct object category or produce backgrounds coherent with the target
domain, making them non-trivial to apply directly to CD-FSOD. To address these
challenges, we propose Domain-RAG, a training-free, retrieval-guided
compositional image generation framework tailored for CD-FSOD. Domain-RAG
consists of three stages: domain-aware background retrieval, domain-guided
background generation, and foreground-background composition. Specifically, the
input image is first decomposed into foreground and background regions. We then
retrieve semantically and stylistically similar images to guide a generative
model in synthesizing a new background, conditioned on both the original and
retrieved contexts. Finally, the preserved foreground is composed with the
newly generated domain-aligned background to form the generated image. Without
requiring any additional supervision or training, Domain-RAG produces
high-quality, domain-consistent samples across diverse tasks, including
CD-FSOD, remote sensing FSOD, and camouflaged FSOD. Extensive experiments show
consistent improvements over strong baselines and establish new
state-of-the-art results. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving
framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow
architecture. A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake
commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates
high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck"
without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective
five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2)
multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene
Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and
(3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and
sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to
achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025

Motivation: 由于现有方法未能充分探索局部内容的细粒度一致性，导致对篡改细节的感知不足和结果不可靠。

Method: 提出CSCL方法，包含图像和文本两个分支，每个分支有两个级联解码器（CCD和SCD），分别捕获模态内上下文一致性和跨模态语义一致性。

Result: 在DGM4数据集上取得最先进的性能，尤其是对篡改内容的定位效果显著。

Conclusion: CSCL通过细粒度一致性学习提升了篡改检测和定位的准确性。

Abstract: To tackle the threat of fake news, the task of detecting and grounding
multi-modal media manipulation DGM4 has received increasing attention. However,
most state-of-the-art methods fail to explore the fine-grained consistency
within local content, usually resulting in an inadequate perception of detailed
forgery and unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
named Contextual-Semantic Consistency Learning (CSCL) to enhance the
fine-grained perception ability of forgery for DGM4. Two branches for image and
text modalities are established, each of which contains two cascaded decoders,
i.e., Contextual Consistency Decoder (CCD) and Semantic Consistency Decoder
(SCD), to capture within-modality contextual consistency and across-modality
semantic consistency, respectively. Both CCD and SCD adhere to the same
criteria for capturing fine-grained forgery details. To be specific, each
module first constructs consistency features by leveraging additional
supervision from the heterogeneous information of each token pair. Then, the
forgery-aware reasoning or aggregating is adopted to deeply seek forgery cues
based on the consistency features. Extensive experiments on DGM4 datasets prove
that CSCL achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially for the results
of grounding manipulated content. Codes and weights are avaliable at

Result: 在HaNSeg和SegRap2023数据集上达到SOTA性能，尤其在中小器官分割上表现突出。

Conclusion: 改进的Mask2Former方法显著提升了医学图像分割的效果，特别是中小器官的分割精度。

Abstract: Medical segmentation plays an important role in clinical applications like
radiation therapy and surgical guidance, but acquiring clinically acceptable
results is difficult. In recent years, progress has been witnessed with the
success of utilizing transformer-like models, such as combining the attention
mechanism with CNN. In particular, transformer-based segmentation models can
extract global information more effectively, compensating for the drawbacks of
CNN modules that focus on local features. However, utilizing transformer
architecture is not easy, because training transformer-based models can be
resource-demanding. Moreover, due to the distinct characteristics in the
medical field, especially when encountering mid-sized and small organs with
compact regions, their results often seem unsatisfactory. For example, using
ViT to segment medical images directly only gives a DSC of less than 50\%,
which is far lower than the clinically acceptable score of 80\%. In this paper,
we used Mask2Former with deformable attention to reduce computation and
proposed offset adjustment strategies to encourage sampling points within the
same organs during attention weights computation, thereby integrating compact
foreground information better. Additionally, we utilized the 4th feature map in
Mask2Former to provide a coarse location of organs, and employed an FCN-based
auxiliary head to help train Mask2Former more quickly using Dice loss. We show
that our model achieves SOTA (State-of-the-Art) performance on the HaNSeg and
SegRap2023 datasets, especially on mid-sized and small organs.Our code is

Motivation: 现有半监督分割方法仅关注分割精度，忽视了可靠性和鲁棒性，而这些特性对安全关键应用（如自动驾驶）至关重要。

Method: 通过引入RSS指标，结合预测精度、校准和不确定性质量，采用谐波平均值综合评估模型性能。

Result: 实验表明半监督方法常在准确性上牺牲可靠性，UniMatchV2表现出鲁棒性但可靠性仍有不足。

Conclusion: 建议采用RSS等更全面的评估指标，以使半监督学习研究更符合实际部署需求。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly
pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised
approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised
segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world
deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively
focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and
robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse
conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as
meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable
environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we
introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines
predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a
harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing
an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models.
Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a
supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability
for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's
robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We
advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like
RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world
deployment needs.

Conclusion: FADE是一种高效、无需训练的视频编辑方法，能够充分利用视频扩散模型的先验知识，显著提升编辑效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video
editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts.
However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in
handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like
motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality
results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy
computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image
editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a
training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages
the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware
factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the
attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are
distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose
a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role.
Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling
trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and
supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and
temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that
our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally
coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code is

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to
impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless,
jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time
responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper,
we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive
framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO
comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual
vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences
with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and
(2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that
generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly
reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce
a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under
textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including
HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or
superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based
methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance,
streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 当前基于NeRF或3D高斯溅射的SLAM方法在处理动态环境的跟踪和重建时表现不佳，尤其是依赖RGB-D输入。本研究旨在解决这一问题，提出了一种仅需RGB输入的方法。

Method: 提出Dy3DGS-SLAM，通过概率模型融合光流掩模和深度掩模生成动态掩模，设计运动损失约束位姿估计网络，利用渲染损失消除动态对象干扰。

Result: 实验结果表明，Dy3DGS-SLAM在动态环境中实现了优于或匹配现有RGB-D方法的跟踪和渲染性能。

Conclusion: Dy3DGS-SLAM通过单目RGB输入和动态掩模融合技术，显著提升了动态场景下的SLAM性能，为动态环境处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods based on Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting excel in reconstructing static
3D scenes but struggle with tracking and reconstruction in dynamic
environments, such as real-world scenes with moving elements. Existing
NeRF-based SLAM approaches addressing dynamic challenges typically rely on
RGB-D inputs, with few methods accommodating pure RGB input. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. To address dynamic
interference, we fuse optical flow masks and depth masks through a
probabilistic model to obtain a fused dynamic mask. With only a single network
iteration, this can constrain tracking scales and refine rendered geometry.
Based on the fused dynamic mask, we designed a novel motion loss to constrain
the pose estimation network for tracking. In mapping, we use the rendering loss
of dynamic pixels, color, and depth to eliminate transient interference and
occlusion caused by dynamic objects. Experimental results demonstrate that
Dy3DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking and rendering in dynamic
environments, outperforming or matching existing RGB-D methods.

Abstract: With the increasing use of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has
become crucial for tasks like crop health monitoring and pest detection.
However, significant domain shifts between source and target domains-due to
environmental differences, crop types, and data acquisition methods-pose
challenges. These domain gaps limit the ability of models to generalize across
regions, seasons, and complex agricultural environments. This paper explores
how Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges, focusing on
their role in enhancing the cross-domain transferability of agricultural image
analysis. DA has gained attention in agricultural vision tasks due to its
potential to mitigate domain heterogeneity. The paper systematically reviews
recent advances in DA for agricultural imagery, particularly its practical
applications in complex agricultural environments. We examine the key drivers
for adopting DA in agriculture, such as limited labeled data, weak model
transferability, and dynamic environmental conditions. We also discuss its use
in crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, highlighting
improvements in performance across regions and seasons. The paper categorizes
DA methods into shallow and deep learning models, with further divisions into
supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. A special focus is
given to adversarial learning-based DA methods, which have shown great promise
in challenging agricultural scenarios. Finally, we review key public datasets
in agricultural imagery, analyzing their value and limitations in DA research.
This review provides a comprehensive framework for researchers, offering
insights into current research gaps and supporting the advancement of DA
methods in agricultural image analysis.

### [494] [MCA-Bench: A Multimodal Benchmark for Evaluating CAPTCHA Robustness Against VLM-based Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05982)
*Zonglin Wu,Yule Xue,Xin Wei,Yiren Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了MCA-Bench，一个统一的多模态CAPTCHA评测基准，用于评估不同CAPTCHA方案的安全性和漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CAPTCHA方案种类多样，但缺乏统一的、大规模的、多模态评测基准，难以系统评估其安全性和鲁棒性。

Method: MCA-Bench整合了多种CAPTCHA类型，采用共享的视觉语言模型架构，针对每类CAPTCHA训练专门的破解代理，实现跨模态评估。

Result: 实验表明，MCA-Bench能有效揭示现代CAPTCHA设计的漏洞分布，并首次定量分析了挑战复杂度、交互深度与模型可解性之间的关系。

Conclusion: 基于实验结果，提出了三项可操作的设计原则，并指出了未来的关键挑战，为CAPTCHA的加固和社区合作奠定了基础。

Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical
defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes
encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and
obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based
questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal
benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this
gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking
suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation
protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune
specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent,
cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench
effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under
varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of
how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate.
Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and
identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA
hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and
code are available online.

### [495] [Bootstrapping World Models from Dynamics Models in Multimodal Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06006)
*Yifu Qiu,Yftah Ziser,Anna Korhonen,Shay B. Cohen,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉与语言基础模型在语言动作下的世界模型和动态模型能力，并通过动态模型提升世界模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估基础模型在语言动作下是否具备真实的世界模型和动态模型能力。

Method: 通过监督学习微调动态模型，利用两种策略（弱监督学习和推理时验证）提升世界模型。

Result: 最佳模型在真实世界子集上比现有图像编辑模型提升15%，并在人类评估中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 动态模型可以显著提升世界模型的性能，尤其在语言动作的任务中。

Abstract: To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic
world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a
dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when
actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models
struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model
through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In
turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main
strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference
time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for
unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We
further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are
weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly,
the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model
to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the
world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric
image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance
competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a
margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and
achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统诊断方法耗时且依赖专家，且数据稀缺且偏颇，需要自动化、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 结合机器学习和预训练深度学习模型提取深层特征表示，无需数据增强。

Result: 该方法在多种评估设置下表现出强大的泛化能力和鲁棒性，分类效果优异且计算成本低。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际临床部署提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Orthopoxvirus infections must be accurately classified from medical pictures
for an easy and early diagnosis and epidemic prevention. The necessity for
automated and scalable solutions is highlighted by the fact that traditional
diagnostic techniques can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation
and there are few and biased data sets of the different types of Orthopox. In
order to improve classification performance and lower computational costs, a
hybrid strategy is put forth in this paper that uses Machine Learning models
combined with pretrained Deep Learning models to extract deep feature
representations without the need for augmented data. The findings show that
this feature extraction method, when paired with other methods in the
state-of-the-art, produces excellent classification outcomes while preserving
training and inference efficiency. The proposed approach demonstrates strong
generalization and robustness across multiple evaluation settings, offering a
scalable and interpretable solution for real-world clinical deployment.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低分辨率输入下的立体视频生成质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能生成立体视频，还能有效增强视频质量，适用于实际低质量视频场景。

Abstract: Stereo video generation has been gaining increasing attention with recent
advancements in video diffusion models. However, most existing methods focus on
generating 3D stereoscopic videos from monocular 2D videos. These approaches
typically assume that the input monocular video is of high quality, making the
task primarily about inpainting occluded regions in the warped video while
preserving disoccluded areas. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline that
not only generates stereo videos but also enhances both left-view and
right-view videos consistently with a single model. Our approach achieves this
by fine-tuning the model on degraded data for restoration, as well as
conditioning the model on warped masks for consistent stereo generation. As a
result, our method can be fine-tuned on a relatively small synthetic stereo
video datasets and applied to low-quality real-world videos, performing both
stereo video generation and restoration. Experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively in
stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs.

### [499] [Sample-Specific Noise Injection For Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06027)
*Yuhao Sun,Jiacheng Zhang,Zesheng Ye,Chaowei Xiao,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了样本特定的分数感知噪声注入（SSNI）框架，通过自适应调整噪声水平t^*，显著提升了扩散基净化方法的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散基净化方法对所有样本使用固定的噪声水平t^*，而本文发现不同样本的最优t^*可能不同。干净的样本应注入更少的噪声，反之亦然。

Method: SSNI利用预训练分数网络估计样本与干净数据分布的偏离程度（即分数范数），并根据分数范数大小通过权重函数自适应调整t^*。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K数据集上，SSNI显著提高了准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 需要为不同样本分配不同的噪声水平，SSNI框架有效实现了这一目标。

Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise
from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward
diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse
generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected
to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled
by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this
paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be
different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should
be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new
framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).
Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data
point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,
based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to
adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise
injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods
results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels
to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出HAVIR方法，通过两个适配器结合生成模型，从fMRI数据中重建复杂视觉信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从脑活动数据中准确重建复杂视觉刺激的挑战。

Method: 使用AutoKL和CLIP适配器分别提取拓扑结构和语义信息，通过Versatile Diffusion融合生成图像。

Result: HAVIR有效重建复杂场景中的结构和语义信息，性能优于现有模型。

Conclusion: HAVIR为神经科学与计算机视觉的桥梁提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between
neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in
decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in
accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from
their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and
multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1)
The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior,
capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to
CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These
complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the
final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information
from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions
describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images
synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that
HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic
information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing
models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的张量到张量层（FIS层），其线性复杂度使其适合处理高维数据，并在分类和异常检测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理高维张量数据时，传统方法计算复杂度高，亟需低复杂度解决方案。

Method: 利用数学工具“角树”和迭代积分（或求和）的签名多参数推广，设计了FIS层。

Result: 在较小ResNet中使用FIS层，性能接近更大模型；异常检测任务中AUROC达97.3%。

Conclusion: FIS层高效且灵活，适用于多种任务，并能显著降低模型复杂度。

Abstract: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern
deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the
need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than
for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost
in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from
the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we
provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing
pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order
generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a
multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums).
The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer
called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with
other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both
classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a
smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of
only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also
used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of
97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing
and modelling codes are publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种浅层-深层协同检测网络（SDS-Net），通过双分支架构和自适应特征融合模块，解决了红外小目标检测（IRSTD）中浅层与深层特征协作不足的问题，显著提升了检测精度和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CNN的红外小目标检测方法忽视了浅层与深层特征的异质性，导致特征协作不足，且缺乏系统性的跨层次特征建模，限制了检测性能。

Method: 提出SDS-Net，采用双分支架构分别处理浅层结构信息和深层语义信息，并通过自适应特征融合模块动态建模跨层特征关系。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，SDS-Net在检测精度和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SDS-Net通过高效的特征协作建模，实现了高精度的红外小目标检测，并具备广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally
overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to
inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information
and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency
relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack
systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of
multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring
substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that
efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the
detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net
introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural
characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving
shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby
achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed.
Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to
dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature
collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three
public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational
complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection
performance and broad application prospects. Our code will be made public at

Motivation: 尽管VLM在医学图像分析中表现出强大的迁移能力，但其可靠性尚未充分研究。研究旨在解决VLM在零样本和少样本条件下性能受限的问题。

Method: 提出全共形适应框架，结合了一种新型训练无关的线性探针解决方法（SS-Text），用于动态适应和校准预训练模型。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在保持相同覆盖保证的同时，将集合效率提升高达27%。

Conclusion: 全共形适应框架显著提升了VLM在医学图像任务中的可靠性和效率，无需额外数据支持。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained at large scale have shown
unprecedented transferability capabilities and are being progressively
integrated into medical image analysis. Although its discriminative potential
has been widely explored, its reliability aspect remains overlooked. This work
investigates their behavior under the increasingly popular split conformal
prediction (SCP) framework, which theoretically guarantees a given error level
on output sets by leveraging a labeled calibration set. However, the zero-shot
performance of VLMs is inherently limited, and common practice involves
few-shot transfer learning pipelines, which cannot absorb the rigid
exchangeability assumptions of SCP. To alleviate this issue, we propose full
conformal adaptation, a novel setting for jointly adapting and conformalizing
pre-trained foundation models, which operates transductively over each test
data point using a few-shot adaptation set. Moreover, we complement this
framework with SS-Text, a novel training-free linear probe solver for VLMs that
alleviates the computational cost of such a transductive approach. We provide
comprehensive experiments using 3 different modality-specialized medical VLMs
and 9 adaptation tasks. Our framework requires exactly the same data as SCP,
and provides consistent relative improvements of up to 27% on set efficiency
while maintaining the same coverage guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统小麦管理依赖人工观察，成本高且难以规模化。现有视觉语言模型因缺乏领域知识，在小麦管理中表现不佳，需针对性改进。

Method: 设计WisWeat数据集，包含预训练、定量测量和指令微调三层结构，并通过微调开源模型验证效果。

Result: 微调后的Qwen2.5 VL 7B模型在小麦压力和生长阶段任务中准确率分别达79.2%和84.6%，显著优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: WisWheat数据集能有效提升视觉语言模型在小麦管理中的表现，为农业智能化提供新方案。

Abstract: Wheat management strategies play a critical role in determining yield.
Traditional management decisions often rely on labour-intensive expert
inspections, which are expensive, subjective and difficult to scale. Recently,
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to enable
scalable, data-driven management support. However, due to a lack of
domain-specific knowledge, directly applying VLMs to wheat management tasks
results in poor quantification and reasoning capabilities, ultimately producing
vague or even misleading management recommendations. In response, we propose
WisWheat, a wheat-specific dataset with a three-layered design to enhance VLM
performance on wheat management tasks: (1) a foundational pretraining dataset
of 47,871 image-caption pairs for coarsely adapting VLMs to wheat morphology;
(2) a quantitative dataset comprising 7,263 VQA-style image-question-answer
triplets for quantitative trait measuring tasks; and (3) an Instruction
Fine-tuning dataset with 4,888 samples targeting biotic and abiotic stress
diagnosis and management plan for different phenological stages. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source VLMs (e.g.,
Qwen2.5 7B) on our dataset leads to significant performance improvements.
Specifically, the Qwen2.5 VL 7B fine-tuned on our wheat instruction dataset
achieves accuracy scores of 79.2% and 84.6% on wheat stress and growth stage
conversation tasks respectively, surpassing even general-purpose commercial
models such as GPT-4o by a margin of 11.9% and 34.6%.

TL;DR: 论文提出了FeedBack Guidance (FBG)，一种自调节的引导方法，用于改进条件扩散模型的样本保真度，同时避免多样性损失和记忆化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)方法虽然能提高样本保真度，但可能损害多样性和导致记忆化问题，因为它对样本施加恒定的引导强度。

Method: FBG通过状态相关的系数动态调节引导强度，假设条件分布被无条件分布线性污染，而非CFG的乘法假设。FBG利用反馈机制在推断过程中自适应调整引导。

Result: 在ImageNet512x512上，FBG显著优于CFG，并与Limited Interval Guidance (LIG)竞争，同时具备更强的数学框架。在文本到图像生成中，FBG能根据提示复杂度自动调整引导强度。

Conclusion: FBG提供了一种动态、自适应的引导方法，改进了现有固定引导强度的局限性，并可与其他引导方法结合使用。

Abstract: While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become standard for improving sample
fidelity in conditional diffusion models, it can harm diversity and induce
memorization by applying constant guidance regardless of whether a particular
sample needs correction. We propose FeedBack Guidance (FBG), which uses a
state-dependent coefficient to self-regulate guidance amounts based on need.
Our approach is derived from first principles by assuming the learned
conditional distribution is linearly corrupted by the unconditional
distribution, contrasting with CFG's implicit multiplicative assumption. Our
scheme relies on feedback of its own predictions about the conditional signal
informativeness to adapt guidance dynamically during inference, challenging the
view of guidance as a fixed hyperparameter. The approach is benchmarked on
ImageNet512x512, where it significantly outperforms Classifier-Free Guidance
and is competitive to Limited Interval Guidance (LIG) while benefitting from a
strong mathematical framework. On Text-To-Image generation, we demonstrate
that, as anticipated, our approach automatically applies higher guidance scales
for complex prompts than for simpler ones and that it can be easily combined
with existing guidance schemes such as CFG or LIG.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLaMR是一种多模态视频检索系统，动态选择最佳模态组合提升检索效果，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索系统通常独立处理视频的多模态内容，导致检索效果不佳，需改进多模态联合检索方法。

Method: 提出CLaMR，联合索引4种模态，并通过多模态骨干网络和模态感知损失动态优化模态选择。

Result: 在MultiVENT 2.0++和MSRVTT上，CLaMR显著优于单模态和多模态基线检索器性能。

Conclusion: CLaMR通过动态模态选择和联合训练在多模态检索中表现优异，且在长视频QA中实用性强。

Abstract: Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision,
speech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat
these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and
subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where
relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple
modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must
dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the
query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that
jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text,
and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal
backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic
modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training
data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale
synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in
various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we
propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard
contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality
usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation
strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade
performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR
consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR
improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4
over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream
utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50%
boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on
LongVideoBench.

language models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos,
while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer
context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been
proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a
long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video
is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long
video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human.
Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy
temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To
fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm.
Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long
videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it
can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into
these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the
shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking
process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for
thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our
VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long
video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema,
outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and
InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source
GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with
7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型双向引导低光图像增强框架（BiLIE），解决了传统方法中全局低频噪声和局部结构不连续的问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧相机在极低光条件下容易丢失细节和出现运动模糊，现有事件相机方法忽略了全局低频噪声和局部结构不连续的影响。

Method: 提出BiLIE框架，包括基于频率高通滤波的事件特征增强（EFE）模块和双向交叉注意力融合（BCAF）机制。

Result: BiLIE在PSNR和LPIPS指标上分别超过现有方法0.96dB和0.03。

Conclusion: BiLIE有效解决了低光图像增强中的噪声和结构问题，并通过新数据集RELIE提升了视觉质量。

Abstract: Under extreme low-light conditions, traditional frame-based cameras, due to
their limited dynamic range and temporal resolution, face detail loss and
motion blur in captured images. To overcome this bottleneck, researchers have
introduced event cameras and proposed event-guided low-light image enhancement
algorithms. However, these methods neglect the influence of global
low-frequency noise caused by dynamic lighting conditions and local structural
discontinuities in sparse event data. To address these issues, we propose an
innovative Bidirectional guided Low-light Image Enhancement framework (BiLIE).
Specifically, to mitigate the significant low-frequency noise introduced by
global illumination step changes, we introduce the frequency high-pass
filtering-based Event Feature Enhancement (EFE) module at the event
representation level to suppress the interference of low-frequency information,
and preserve and highlight the high-frequency edges.Furthermore, we design a
Bidirectional Cross Attention Fusion (BCAF) mechanism to acquire high-frequency
structures and edges while suppressing structural discontinuities and local
noise introduced by sparse event guidance, thereby generating smoother fused
representations.Additionally, considering the poor visual quality and color
bias in existing datasets, we provide a new dataset (RELIE), with high-quality
ground truth through a reliable enhancement scheme. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed BiLIE outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 0.96dB in PSNR and 0.03 in LPIPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于高质量矢量化输入和计算密集型Transformer架构，难以在实际中应用。

Method: 提出了基于卷积操作的耦合卷积LSTM（CCLSTM），无需矢量输入或自注意力机制，捕获时空动态。

Result: CCLSTM在占用流指标上实现SOTA，并在Waymo挑战赛中排名第一。

Conclusion: CCLSTM是一种高效且轻量的解决方案，适用于自动驾驶中的动态Agent预测任务。

Abstract: Predicting future states of dynamic agents is a fundamental task in
autonomous driving. An expressive representation for this purpose is Occupancy
Flow Fields, which provide a scalable and unified format for modeling motion,
spatial extent, and multi-modal future distributions. While recent methods have
achieved strong results using this representation, they often depend on
high-quality vectorized inputs, which are unavailable or difficult to generate
in practice, and the use of transformer-based architectures, which are
computationally intensive and costly to deploy. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{Coupled Convolutional LSTM (CCLSTM)}, a lightweight, end-to-end
trainable architecture based solely on convolutional operations. Without
relying on vectorized inputs or self-attention mechanisms, CCLSTM effectively
captures temporal dynamics and spatial occupancy-flow correlations using a
compact recurrent convolutional structure. Despite its simplicity, CCLSTM
achieves state-of-the-art performance on occupancy flow metrics and, as of this
submission, ranks \(1^{\text{st}}\) in all metrics on the 2024 Waymo Occupancy
and Flow Prediction Challenge leaderboard.

### [510] [A Novel Large-scale Crop Dataset and Dual-stream Transformer Method for Fine-grained Hierarchical Crop Classification from Integrated Hyperspectral EnMAP Data and Multispectral Sentinel-2 Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06155)

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合高光谱和多时相卫星数据的精细作物分类方法，通过构建H2Crop数据集和双流Transformer架构，显著提升了分类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精细作物分类对精准农业和粮食安全监测至关重要，但目前缺乏结合高光谱和多时相数据的研究。

Method: 利用30米分辨率的EnMAP高光谱数据与Sentinel-2时间序列构建H2Crop数据集，并提出双流Transformer架构，分别处理光谱-空间和时间特征。

Result: 实验表明，加入高光谱数据后，F1分数平均提升4.2%，最高达6.3%，优于现有深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 本文方法在精细作物分类中表现出色，且高光谱数据在不同时间窗口和作物变化场景中均具有一致性优势。

Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and
food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological
dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and
subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from
hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce
currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types
annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical
hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP
hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated
field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a
vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and
hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer
architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates
two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained
signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer
extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed
hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously
delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments
demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series
yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive
comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep
learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of
hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

TL;DR: MF^2是一个新基准，用于评估模型能否全面理解长视频内容，通过真实与虚假陈述对测试模型的深层理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基准过于关注细节或生成问题过于简单的问题，提出更接近人类理解的评估方法。

Method: 使用50多部公开授权电影，每部电影配对手工构建的真实与虚假陈述对，共850多对，测试模型的核心叙事理解能力。

Result: 当前最先进模型远不如人类表现，突显了模型在关键叙事信息上的不足。

Conclusion: MF^2揭示了模型在深层理解长内容上的局限，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic
understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge,
partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral,
``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval
over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically
generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are
easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this
paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can
comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length
movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,
open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs
-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.
These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and
emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that
humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice
formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models
must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases
like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our
experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art
models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of
the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over
critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

Abstract: In this report, we address the task of online mistake detection, which is
vital in domains like industrial automation and education, where real-time
video analysis allows human operators to correct errors as they occur. While
previous work focuses on procedural errors involving action order, broader
error types must be addressed for real-world use. We introduce an online
mistake detection framework that handles both procedural and execution errors
(e.g., motor slips or tool misuse). Upon detecting an error, we use a large
language model (LLM) to generate explanatory feedback. Experiments on the
HoloAssist benchmark confirm the effectiveness of our approach, where our
approach is placed second on the mistake detection task.

Result: 在基准数据集和遥感任务中表现出优越的性能、稳定性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: SatelliteFormula成功实现了复杂环境变量的可解释建模，为数据驱动学习与物理理解之间搭建了桥梁。

Abstract: We propose SatelliteFormula, a novel symbolic regression framework that
derives physically interpretable expressions directly from multi-spectral
remote sensing imagery. Unlike traditional empirical indices or black-box
learning models, SatelliteFormula combines a Vision Transformer-based encoder
for spatial-spectral feature extraction with physics-guided constraints to
ensure consistency and interpretability. Existing symbolic regression methods
struggle with the high-dimensional complexity of multi-spectral data; our
method addresses this by integrating transformer representations into a
symbolic optimizer that balances accuracy and physical plausibility. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets and remote sensing tasks demonstrate superior
performance, stability, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. SatelliteFormula enables interpretable modeling of complex
environmental variables, bridging the gap between data-driven learning and
physical understanding.

TL;DR: STSBench是一个基于场景的框架，用于评估自动驾驶视觉-语言模型（VLMs）的整体理解能力。它通过真实标注挖掘交通场景，生成选择题以评测模型，并揭示现有模型在复杂环境下时空推理能力的不足。


<details>

Motivation: 现有评测基准主要关注单一视角下的语义任务，缺乏对多视角、多帧视频的时空推理能力评估，而这对自动驾驶至关重要。

Method: 框架自动从数据集中挖掘预定义交通场景，提供用户界面进行人工验证，并生成测评选择题。应用于NuScenes数据集，创建首个基于3D感知的时空推理评测基准STSnu。

Result: 评测发现现有模型在复杂交通动态推理能力上存在明显不足。STSnu涵盖43种场景和971道验证问题，揭示了模型的短板。

Conclusion: STSBench填补了时空评估的核心空白，推动了更鲁棒、可解释的自动驾驶VLMs的发展。

Abstract: We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic
understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The
framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset
using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for
efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model
evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first
benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs
based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target
off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint
and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk
assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert
VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or
LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle
actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial
capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios
spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified
multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings
in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in
complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for
architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By
addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the
development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-图像检索技术在真实场景中存在局限性，用户通常通过多轮交互精确定位脑海中模糊的图像，而现有方法缺乏直观有效的反馈机制。

Method: 提出GenIR方法，利用扩散模型生成图像作为反馈，帮助用户逐步优化查询，同时设计了一个自动化流程生成高质量MIR数据集。

Result: 实验表明，GenIR在多轮MIR任务中显著优于现有交互式方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为MIR任务提供了数据集和有效方法，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image
retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications
remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot
action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind,
that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental
representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task
of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored
setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through
multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful
interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with
clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or
abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective
for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative
multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to
explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic
visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to
refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully
automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing
interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with
a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation
for future research in this direction.

Result: 通用模型在基础任务上表现良好，但在需要医学知识的任务中表现显著下降；专用医学模型表现不如通用模型。

Conclusion: 需进一步优化视觉语言模型以适应手术环境的复杂性，为下一代内窥镜AI系统的发展提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to
generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown
promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first
large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs)
for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a
diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and
extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions:
(1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can
they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3)
How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context?
Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception
tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels
comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates
significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that
specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models
across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet
optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight
the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique
challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for
the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key
areas for improvement in medical visual language models.

Abstract: Training deep learning models on petabyte-scale Earth observation (EO) data
requires separating compute resources from data storage. However, standard
PyTorch data loaders cannot keep modern GPUs utilized when streaming GeoTIFF
files directly from cloud storage. In this work, we benchmark GeoTIFF loading
throughput from both cloud object storage and local SSD, systematically testing
different loader configurations and data parameters. We focus on tile-aligned
reads and worker thread pools, using Bayesian optimization to find optimal
settings for each storage type. Our optimized configurations increase remote
data loading throughput by 20x and local throughput by 4x compared to default
settings. On three public EO benchmarks, models trained with optimized remote
loading achieve the same accuracy as local training within identical time
budgets. We improve validation IoU by 6-15% and maintain 85-95% GPU utilization

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have driven
breakthroughs in visual question answering. Yet, a critical gap persists,
`conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept
despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To
address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset
featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems'
capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g.,
Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form.
Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a
striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while
models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in
path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting
pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These
findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual
understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant
reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like
conceptualization in AI visual models. The Visual Graph Arena is available at:

Abstract: Perceiving the world from both egocentric (first-person) and exocentric
(third-person) perspectives is fundamental to human cognition, enabling rich
and complementary understanding of dynamic environments. In recent years,
allowing the machines to leverage the synergistic potential of these dual
perspectives has emerged as a compelling research direction in video
understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of video
understanding from both exocentric and egocentric viewpoints. We begin by
highlighting the practical applications of integrating egocentric and
exocentric techniques, envisioning their potential collaboration across
domains. We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications.
Next, we systematically organize and review recent advancements into three main
research directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric
understanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis,
and (3) joint learning frameworks that unify both perspectives. For each
direction, we analyze a diverse set of tasks and relevant works. Additionally,
we discuss benchmark datasets that support research in both perspectives,
evaluating their scope, diversity, and applicability. Finally, we discuss
limitations in current works and propose promising future research directions.
By synthesizing insights from both perspectives, our goal is to inspire
advancements in video understanding and artificial intelligence, bringing
machines closer to perceiving the world in a human-like manner. A GitHub repo

leveraging our new dataset, we introduce a new relightable avatar
representation based on 3D Gaussian primitives that we animate with a

new hybrid neural shading approach, combining a neural diffuse BRDF with an
analytical specular term. Our method reconstructs disentangled materials from
our dynamic light stage recordings and enables all-frequency relighting of our

TL;DR: STARFlow是一种基于归一化流的可扩展生成模型，通过结合Transformer和自回归流的优势，在高分辨率图像合成中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是开发一种能够在高分辨率图像合成中表现出色的生成模型，结合归一化流和Transformer的优势。

Method: STARFlow的核心是Transformer自回归流（TARFlow），通过深度-浅层次设计和潜在空间建模等创新提升扩展性，并使用一种新颖的引导算法提高样本质量。

Result: STARFlow在类别条件和文本条件图像生成任务中表现优异，接近扩散模型的最先进水平。

Conclusion: STARFlow首次成功展示了归一化流在大规模高分辨率任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows
that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core
of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the
expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities
of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality
of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation,
we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to
significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep
Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,
complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally
efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of
pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level
modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample
quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling
exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.
STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and
text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion
models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful
demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and
resolution.

TL;DR: ExAct是一个新的视频-语言基准测试，专注于对熟练人类活动的专家级理解，包含3521个专家策划的视频问答对，跨越6个领域。现有模型表现远低于人类专家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够评估视频语言模型（VLMs）在理解和分析人类专业技能方面能力的基准测试，填补现有技术在专家级任务上的不足。

Method: 构建了包含11种物理活动的3521个视频问答对的基准测试ExAct，要求从五个精心设计的选项中选出正确答案。

Result: GPT-4o在ExAct上的准确率为44.70%，远低于人类专家的82.02%，显示出VLMs在专家级任务上的显著差距。

Conclusion: ExAct为开发和评估能够精确理解人类技能的VLMs提供了有价值的工具，未来有望推动相关技术进步。

Abstract: We present ExAct, a new video-language benchmark for expert-level
understanding of skilled physical human activities. Our new benchmark contains
3521 expert-curated video question-answer pairs spanning 11 physical activities
in 6 domains: Sports, Bike Repair, Cooking, Health, Music, and Dance. ExAct
requires the correct answer to be selected from five carefully designed
candidate options, thus necessitating a nuanced, fine-grained, expert-level
understanding of physical human skills. Evaluating the recent state-of-the-art
VLMs on ExAct reveals a substantial performance gap relative to human expert
performance. Specifically, the best-performing GPT-4o model achieves only
44.70% accuracy, well below the 82.02% attained by trained human
specialists/experts. We believe that ExAct will be beneficial for developing
and evaluating VLMs capable of precise understanding of human skills in various
physical and procedural domains. Dataset and code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出CoMemo，一种双路径架构，结合上下文图像路径和图像记忆路径，解决大视觉语言模型中视觉信息逐步忽视和2D结构关系丢失的问题，并通过RoPE-DHR位置编码机制提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型（LVLM）基于大语言模型（LLM）构建，但其架构设计在多模态处理中存在不足，如注意力分配的双峰分布导致中间视觉内容被逐步忽视，以及传统位置编码无法保留2D结构关系。

Method: 提出CoMemo双路径架构（上下文图像路径和图像记忆路径）及RoPE-DHR位置编码机制，通过缩略图位置聚合维护2D空间感知。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，CoMemo在长上下文理解、多图像推理和视觉问答任务上表现优于传统LVLM架构。

Conclusion: CoMemo通过创新架构和位置编码机制有效解决了LVLM中的视觉信息忽视和空间关系丢失问题，展现了优越性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models built upon Large Language
Models have established aligning visual features with LLM representations as
the dominant paradigm. However, inherited LLM architectural designs introduce
suboptimal characteristics for multimodal processing. First, LVLMs exhibit a
bimodal distribution in attention allocation, leading to the progressive
neglect of middle visual content as context expands. Second, conventional
positional encoding schemes fail to preserve vital 2D structural relationships
when processing dynamic high-resolution images. To address these limitations,
we propose CoMemo - a dual-path architecture that combines a Context image path
with an image Memory path for visual processing, effectively alleviating visual
information neglect. Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional
encoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to
maintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended
sequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context
comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering,
demonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM
architectures. Project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在地球观测任务中受限于训练数据的规模、地理覆盖和光谱多样性，需要更好的全局可迁移表示学习方法。

Method: 通过自监督学习整合雷达和光学输入，采用局部-全局对比学习和双中心机制，解决土地覆盖的长尾分布问题。

Result: 在GEO-Bench和Copernicus-Bench的分类和分割任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: TerraFM通过多模态融合和自监督学习策略，显著提升了地球观测任务的性能。

Abstract: Modern Earth observation (EO) increasingly leverages deep learning to harness
the scale and diversity of satellite imagery across sensors and regions. While
recent foundation models have demonstrated promising generalization across EO
tasks, many remain limited by the scale, geographical coverage, and spectral
diversity of their training data, factors critical for learning globally
transferable representations. In this work, we introduce TerraFM, a scalable
self-supervised learning model that leverages globally distributed Sentinel-1
and Sentinel-2 imagery, combined with large spatial tiles and land-cover aware
sampling to enrich spatial and semantic coverage. By treating sensing
modalities as natural augmentations in our self-supervised approach, we unify
radar and optical inputs via modality-specific patch embeddings and adaptive
cross-attention fusion. Our training strategy integrates local-global
contrastive learning and introduces a dual-centering mechanism that
incorporates class-frequency-aware regularization to address long-tailed
distributions in land cover.TerraFM achieves strong generalization on both
classification and segmentation tasks, outperforming prior models on GEO-Bench
and Copernicus-Bench. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本TTS虽能高保真还原说话者音色，但难以通过调整副语言/非语言信息来控制听众的语音印象。

Method: 使用低维向量表示不同语音印象对的强度，并通过大语言模型生成目标印象向量。

Result: 主客观评估表明该方法能有效控制语音印象。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了零样本TTS中语音印象的灵活控制，并简化了目标印象生成过程。

Abstract: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the
listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved
high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to
control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains
challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in
zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the
intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results
of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's
effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a
large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural
language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for
manual optimization.

Motivation: 尽管CTC假设标签上下文独立，但现代强大编码器使其ILM隐含学习上下文依赖，研究这种依赖关系有助于提升性能。

Method: 提出基于KD的上下文依赖ILM估计方法，并引入两种正则化方法进行优化。

Result: 实验显示上下文依赖ILM在跨域评估中优于上下文独立先验，KD平滑方法较浅融合提升13%以上。

Conclusion: CTC能学习上下文依赖ILM，提出的KD平滑方法显著优于其他ILM估计方法。

Abstract: Although connectionist temporal classification (CTC) has the label context
independence assumption, it can still implicitly learn a context-dependent
internal language model (ILM) due to modern powerful encoders. In this work, we
investigate the implicit context dependency modeled in the ILM of CTC. To this
end, we propose novel context-dependent ILM estimation methods for CTC based on
knowledge distillation (KD) with theoretical justifications. Furthermore, we
introduce two regularization methods for KD. We conduct experiments on
Librispeech and TED-LIUM Release 2 datasets for in-domain and cross-domain
evaluation, respectively. Experimental results show that context-dependent ILMs
outperform the context-independent priors in cross-domain evaluation,
indicating that CTC learns a context-dependent ILM. The proposed label-level KD
with smoothing method surpasses other ILM estimation approaches, with more than
13% relative improvement in word error rate compared to shallow fusion.

*Xutong Jin,Bo Pang,Chenxi Xu,Xinyun Hou,Guoping Wang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经隐式表示的新方法Neural Acoustic Transfer，用于实时预测动态变化环境中的声场效果，解决了传统方法在复杂场景下效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统声学传输方法在动态变化环境中效率低下，无法实时处理复杂场景中的声音变化。

Method: 利用神经隐式表示编码预计算的声学传输及其变化，结合快速蒙特卡洛边界元方法和GPU加速的标准边界元方法生成训练数据。

Result: 在多种声学传输场景中验证了方法的数值准确性和运行效率（30秒音频仅需几毫秒）。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效准确地建模动态环境中的声音行为，适用于虚拟现实、增强现实等交互应用。

Abstract: Previous acoustic transfer methods rely on extensive precomputation and
storage of data to enable real-time interaction and auditory feedback. However,
these methods struggle with complex scenes, especially when dynamic changes in
object position, material, and size significantly alter sound effects. These
continuous variations lead to fluctuating acoustic transfer distributions,
making it challenging to represent with basic data structures and render
efficiently in real time. To address this challenge, we present Neural Acoustic
Transfer, a novel approach that utilizes an implicit neural representation to
encode precomputed acoustic transfer and its variations, allowing for real-time
prediction of sound fields under varying conditions. To efficiently generate
the training data required for the neural acoustic field, we developed a fast
Monte-Carlo-based boundary element method (BEM) approximation for general
scenarios with smooth Neumann conditions. Additionally, we implemented a
GPU-accelerated version of standard BEM for scenarios requiring higher
precision. These methods provide the necessary training data, enabling our
neural network to accurately model the sound radiation space. We demonstrate
our method's numerical accuracy and runtime efficiency (within several
milliseconds for 30s audio) through comprehensive validation and comparisons in
diverse acoustic transfer scenarios. Our approach allows for efficient and
accurate modeling of sound behavior in dynamically changing environments, which
can benefit a wide range of interactive applications such as virtual reality,
augmented reality, and advanced audio production.

Motivation: 图像数据的自回归模型中，像素处理顺序对性能至关重要。本文旨在探索通过小像素块预测图像其余部分的性能，并比较不同像素选择策略的优劣。

Method: 提出了一个改进的ConvNADE模型，适用于真实值和彩色图像，并测试了随机像素块与低差异像素块（受准蒙特卡洛理论启发）对图像重建的影响。

Result: 实验表明，低差异像素块能降低测试损失并生成更真实的图像重建结果。

Conclusion: 选择类似低差异序列的像素块能显著提升图像预测性能，改进后的ConvNADE模型在真实值和彩色图像上表现优异。

Abstract: Autoregressive models are often employed to learn distributions of image data
by decomposing the $D$-dimensional density function into a product of
one-dimensional conditional distributions. Each conditional depends on
preceding variables (pixels, in the case of image data), making the order in
which variables are processed fundamental to the model performance. In this
paper, we study the problem of observing a small subset of image pixels
(referred to as a pixel patch) to predict the unobserved parts of the image. As
our prediction mechanism, we propose a generalized and computationally
efficient version of the convolutional neural autoregressive distribution
estimator (ConvNADE) model adapted for real-valued and color images. Moreover,
we investigate the quality of image reconstruction when observing both random
pixel patches and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo
theory. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that choosing the pixels
akin to a low-discrepancy sequence reduces test loss and produces more
realistic reconstructed images.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双边多尺度信息融合的网络FPDANet，用于解决ResNet在处理胎儿超声图像分类任务时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ResNet在胎儿超声图像分类中表现不佳，因其无法有效关联上下文信息，且图像本身具有低对比度、高相似性和高噪声的问题。

Method: 设计了位置注意机制DAN模块和双边多尺度FPAN信息融合模块，以增强特征表示并捕获不同尺度的上下文和全局特征依赖。

Result: FPDANet在Top-1和Top-5指标上分别取得了91.05%和100%的分类结果。

Conclusion: FPDANet在胎儿超声图像分类任务中表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: ResNet has been widely used in image classification tasks due to its ability
to model the residual dependence of constant mappings for linear computation.
However, the ResNet method adopts a unidirectional transfer of features and
lacks an effective method to correlate contextual information, which is not
effective in classifying fetal ultrasound images in the classification task,
and fetal ultrasound images have problems such as low contrast, high
similarity, and high noise. Therefore, we propose a bilateral multi-scale
information fusion network-based FPDANet to address the above challenges.
Specifically, we design the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module, which
utilizes the similarity of features to establish the dependency of different
spatial positional features and enhance the feature representation. In
addition, we design a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module to
capture contextual and global feature dependencies at different feature scales,
thereby further improving the model representation. FPDANet classification
results obtained 91.05\% and 100\% in Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, respectively,
and the experimental results proved the effectiveness and robustness of
FPDANet.

Method: LinGuinE 使用放射科医生提供的初始肿瘤位置，通过刚性配准传播采样点，并用分类器筛选有效点生成新时间点的分割。

Result: 在两个测试数据集上，LinGuinE 的 Dice 分数提高了超过 20%，且适用于任意起始时间点。

Conclusion: LinGuinE 在纵向肿瘤分割中表现出优越性能，为临床提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in
radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in
assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the
tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal
study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or
semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces
LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours.
A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the
tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside
this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration.
A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour;
these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We
test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung
tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE
improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63
longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting
point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields
the best results on both test datasets.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is poised to augment dermatological care by enabling
scalable image-based diagnostics. Yet, the development of robust and equitable
models remains hindered by datasets that fail to capture the clinical and
demographic complexity of real-world practice. This complexity stems from
region-specific disease distributions, wide variation in skin tones, and the
underrepresentation of outpatient scenarios from non-Western populations. We
introduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising
over 5,450 clinical images from approximately 3,000 patients across outpatient
clinics in South India. Each image is annotated by board-certified
dermatologists with over 240 distinct diagnoses, structured under a
hierarchical, etiology-based taxonomy adapted from Rook's classification. The
dataset captures a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions and tonal variation
commonly seen in Indian outpatient care. We benchmark a range of architectures
including convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet),
transformer-based models (ViT, MaxViT, Swin), and Concept Bottleneck Models to
establish baseline performance and explore how anatomical and concept-level
cues may be integrated. These results are intended to guide future efforts
toward interpretable and clinically realistic models. DermaCon-IN provides a
scalable and representative foundation for advancing dermatology AI in

Motivation: ResNet在胎儿超声图像分类任务中因缺乏上下文信息关联而表现不佳，同时胎儿超声图像存在低对比度、高相似性和高噪声等问题，因此需要新的方法来提升分类效果。

Method: 作者设计了位置注意力机制（DAN）模块，利用特征相似性建立空间位置特征的依赖关系，并增强特征表示；此外，还提出了双边多尺度（FPAN）信息融合模块，以捕获不同尺度下的上下文和全局特征依赖。

Result: FPDANet在Top-1和Top-5指标下分别取得了91.05%和100%的分类结果，证明了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的FPDANet通过结合位置注意力机制和多尺度信息融合，显著提升了胎儿超声图像分类任务的性能。

Abstract: ResNet has been widely used in image classification tasks due to its ability
to model the residual dependence of constant mappings for linear computation.
However, the ResNet method adopts a unidirectional transfer of features and
lacks an effective method to correlate contextual information, which is not
effective in classifying fetal ultrasound images in the classification task,
and fetal ultrasound images have problems such as low contrast, high
similarity, and high noise. Therefore, we propose a bilateral multi-scale
information fusion network-based FPDANet to address the above challenges.
Specifically, we design the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module, which
utilizes the similarity of features to establish the dependency of different
spatial positional features and enhance the feature representation. In
addition, we design a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module to
capture contextual and global feature dependencies at different feature scales,
thereby further improving the model representation. FPDANet classification
results obtained 91.05\% and 100\% in Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, respectively,
and the experimental results proved the effectiveness and robustness of
FPDANet.

TL;DR: LinGuinE是一种自动化方法，用于分割肺部肿瘤的纵向CT扫描数据，通过刚性配准和点击有效性分类器提高分割准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏自动或半自动的纵向肿瘤分割方法，这对于放疗、手术干预和化疗反应评估至关重要。

Method: LinGuinE通过医生提供的初始肿瘤位置信息，利用刚性配准和点击有效性分类器，自动生成其他时间点的肿瘤分割结果。

Result: 在临床和公开数据集上的测试表明，LinGuinE将Dice系数提高了20%以上，且适用于任意起始时间点。

Conclusion: LinGuinE在纵向肺部肿瘤分割中表现优异，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in
radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in
assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the
tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal
study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or
semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces
LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours.
A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the
tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside
this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration.
A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour;
these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We
test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung
tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE
improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63
longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting
point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields
the best results on both test datasets.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is poised to augment dermatological care by enabling
scalable image-based diagnostics. Yet, the development of robust and equitable
models remains hindered by datasets that fail to capture the clinical and
demographic complexity of real-world practice. This complexity stems from
region-specific disease distributions, wide variation in skin tones, and the
underrepresentation of outpatient scenarios from non-Western populations. We
introduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising
over 5,450 clinical images from approximately 3,000 patients across outpatient
clinics in South India. Each image is annotated by board-certified
dermatologists with over 240 distinct diagnoses, structured under a
hierarchical, etiology-based taxonomy adapted from Rook's classification. The
dataset captures a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions and tonal variation
commonly seen in Indian outpatient care. We benchmark a range of architectures
including convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet),
transformer-based models (ViT, MaxViT, Swin), and Concept Bottleneck Models to
establish baseline performance and explore how anatomical and concept-level
cues may be integrated. These results are intended to guide future efforts
toward interpretable and clinically realistic models. DermaCon-IN provides a
scalable and representative foundation for advancing dermatology AI in
real-world settings.
