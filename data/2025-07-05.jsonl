Additional information, such as user reviews,\ndownload counts, and uses-permission, was collected from the Google Play Store.\nWe evaluate regression and classification models across three feature sets: a\nminimal Size-only baseline, a domain-informed Handpicked set, and a Voting set\nderived via feature selection algorithms. Regression models perform poorly due\nto skewed data, with low $R^2$ scores. However, when reframed as binary\nclassification (Popular vs. Unpopular), results improve significantly.

In this paper, we\nfirst investigate the root causes of these decoding failures through an\nempirical analysis of token-level entropy during RTL generation. Our findings\nreveal that LLMs exhibit low confidence in regions of structural ambiguity or\nsemantic complexity, showing that standard decoding strategies fail to\ndifferentiate between regions requiring determinism (syntax-critical regions)\nand those that benefit from creative exploratory variability (design-critical\nregions). Then, to overcome this, we introduce DecoRTL, a novel run-time\ndecoding strategy, that is both syntax-aware and contrastive for RTL code\ngeneration. DecoRTL integrates two complementary components: (i)\nself-consistency sampling, which generates multiple candidates and re-ranks\nthem based on token-level agreement to promote correctness while maintaining\ndiversity; and (ii) syntax-aware temperature adaptation, which classifies\ntokens by their syntactical and functional roles and adjusts the sampling\ntemperature accordingly, enforcing low temperature for syntax-critical tokens\nand higher temperature for exploratory ones. Our approach operates entirely at\ninference time without requiring any additional model fine-tuning.

These\nprocessors exchange massive amounts of data at cache-line granularity,\nprompting the adoption of new interconnect protocols like CXL, NVLink, and\nUALink, designed for high bandwidth and small payloads. However, the increasing\ntransfer rates of these protocols heighten susceptibility to errors. While\nmechanisms like Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) and Forward Error Correction\n(FEC) are standard for reliable data transmission, scaling chip interconnects\nto multi-node configurations introduces new challenges, particularly in\nmanaging silently dropped flits in switching devices. This paper introduces\nImplicit Sequence Number (ISN), a novel mechanism that ensures precise flit\ndrop detection and in-order delivery without adding header overhead.\nAdditionally, we propose Reliability Extended Link (RXL), an extension of CXL\nthat incorporates ISN to support scalable, reliable multi-node interconnects\nwhile maintaining compatibility with the existing flit structure.

This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets,\nincluding three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial\nimprovements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI\nCompetition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on\nDataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we\nsystematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows\nranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results\nestablish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification\nin addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in\nthis domain."}

Accepted for publication in: 2025 IEEE 33nd\n  International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE), Doctor Symposium\n  Paper, 5 pages", "summary": "Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are systems that integrate both\nphysical and computational capabilities, which can adjust in response to\nchanging parameters. Furthermore, they increasingly incorporate human-machine\ncollaboration, allowing them to benefit from the individual strengths of humans\nand machines. Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) represents the most advanced paradigm\nof human-machine collaboration, envisioning seamless teamwork between humans\nand machines. However, achieving effective and seamless HMT in adaptive CPS is\nchallenging. While adaptive CPS already benefit from feedback loops such as\nMAPE-K, there is still a gap in integrating humans into these feedback loops\ndue to different operational cadences of humans and machines. Further, HMT\nrequires constant monitoring of human operators, collecting potentially\nsensitive information about their actions and behavior. Respecting the privacy\nand human values of the actors of the CPS is crucial for the success of\nhuman-machine teams. This research addresses these challenges by: (1)\ndeveloping novel methods and processes for integrating HMT into adaptive CPS,\nfocusing on human-machine interaction principles and their incorporation into\nadaptive feedback loops found in CPS, and (2) creating frameworks for\nintegrating, verifying, and validating ethics and human values throughout the\nsystem lifecycle, starting from requirements engineering."}

While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the\nsame instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation\nframeworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This\noverlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences\nin annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a\npopular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in\ntraining ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying\nassumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this\npaper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,\nhighlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and\nnoise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have\naddressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual\nframework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance\nselection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the\nintegration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay\na conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the\ncomplexities of real-world annotation."}
