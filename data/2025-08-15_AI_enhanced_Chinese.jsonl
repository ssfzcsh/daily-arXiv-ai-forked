Optimizing compilers are key to realizing this potential, as they\nminimize expensive resource usage and limit error rates. A critical compilation\nstep is qubit mapping and routing (QMR), which finds mappings from circuit\nqubits to qubits on a target device and plans instruction execution while\nsatisfying the device's connectivity constraints. The challenge is that the\nlandscape of quantum architectures is incredibly diverse and fast-evolving.\nGiven this diversity, hundreds of papers have addressed the QMR problem for\ndifferent qubit hardware, connectivity constraints, and quantum error\ncorrection schemes.\n  We present an approach for automatically generating qubit mapping and routing\ncompilers for arbitrary quantum architectures. Though each QMR problem is\ndifferent, we identify a common core structure-device state machine-that we use\nto formulate an abstract QMR problem. Our formulation naturally leads to a\ndomain-specific language, Marol, for specifying QMR problems-for example, the\nwell-studied NISQ mapping and routing problem requires only 12 lines of Marol.\nWe demonstrate that QMR problems, defined in Marol, can be solved with a\npowerful parametric solver that can be instantiated for any Marol program.

A qualitative\nanalysis stratified by face image quality and utterance masking prevalence\nfurther substantiates the complementary strengths of each component.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u540c\u6b65\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u975e\u540c\u6b65\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u878d\u5408\u4e92\u8865\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86ASD\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3ASD\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u56e0\u906e\u6321\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u5e72\u6270\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cFVA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u540c\u6b65\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u975e\u540c\u6b65\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u878d\u5408\uff1b\u4f18\u5316FVA\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Ego4D-AVD\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u4f7f\u7528TalkNet\u548cLight-ASD\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8670.2%\u548c66.7%\u7684mAP\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u67b6\u6784\u878d\u5408\u4e92\u8865\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86ASD\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Unfortunately, under-represented groups often have lower\nincoming spatial ability. Courses that improve spatial skills exist but are not\nwidely used. Virtual reality (VR) has been suggested as a possible tool for\nteaching spatial reasoning since students are more accurate and complete\nspatial tasks more quickly in three dimensions. However, no prior work has\ndeveloped or evaluated a fully-structured VR spatial skills course. Objectives:\nWe seek to assess the effectiveness of teaching spatial reasoning in VR, both\nin isolation as a structured training curriculum and also in comparison to\ntraditional methods. Methods: We adapted three modules of an existing\npencil-and-paper course to VR, leveraging educational scaffolding and real-time\nfeedback in the design. We evaluated our three-week course in a study with\n$n=24$ undergraduate introductory STEM students, capturing both quantitative\nspatial ability gains (using pre- and post test scores on validated\nassessments) and qualitative insights (from a post-study questionnaire).

Conventional implementations suffer from critical\nlimitations: low timing accuracy due to large-scale timer traversal and high\ncomputational overhead for new timer insertion. This paper presents a\nhybrid-architecture hardware priority queue based on systolic arrays and shift\nregisters for efficient timer queue management. The design uniquely supports\nfive operations: enqueue, dequeue, delete, update, and peek.To the best of our\nknowledge, it is the first hardware priority queue enabling in-queue priority\nupdates.

To overcome the\nscarcity of data in this field, we employ a corpus collection strategy based on\nthe domain knowledge framework of analog circuits. High-quality, accessible\ntextbooks across relevant subfields are systematically curated and cleaned into\na textual domain corpus. To address the complexity of knowledge of analog\ncircuits, we introduce a granular domain knowledge distillation method. Raw,\nunlabeled domain corpus is decomposed into typical, granular learning nodes,\nwhere a multi-agent framework distills implicit knowledge embedded in\nunstructured text into question-answer data pairs with detailed reasoning\nprocesses, yielding a fine-grained, learnable dataset for fine-tuning. To\naddress the unexplored challenges in training analog circuit foundation models,\nwe explore and share our training methods through both theoretical analysis and\nexperimental validation. We finally establish a fine-tuning-centric training\nparadigm, customizing and implementing a neighborhood self-constrained\nsupervised fine-tuning algorithm. This approach enhances training outcomes by\nconstraining the perturbation magnitude between the model's output\ndistributions before and after training. In practice, we train the\nQwen2.5-32B-Instruct model to obtain AnalogSeeker, which achieves 85.04%\naccuracy on AMSBench-TQA, the analog circuit knowledge evaluation benchmark,\nwith a 15.67% point improvement over the original model and is competitive with\nmainstream commercial models.

However, data downloading from EO satellites faces significant\nchallenges due to the limited number of ground stations and the brief\ncommunication windows with them. Conversely, emerging LEO constellations like\nStarlink have enabled continuous connectivity and revolutionized access for\nordinary users globally, who can connect via a simple satellite dish. In this\npaper, we study the feasibility of supporting EO satellites with Starlink\nsatellite infrastructure and introduce a novel data delivery system, designated\nas \"Starlink Space User\" (SSU), for relaying data from observation satellites.\nSSU treats EO satellites as space users of Starlink, facilitating efficient\ndata transfer to Earth.

All treatments were trained\nusing a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and\ntransfer learning techniques.

While prior research has primarily focused on identifying\nwhether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content\ninfluences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock\nmarket, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),\ncan be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we\ntake a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains\n154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale\nanalysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals\nthat people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text\nand visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We\npropose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify\nhow users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based\nagent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human\nresponses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response\nModel Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol\n(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM.

However, their\nperformance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as\nindustrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and\ndifficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data\nsensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional\nfine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.\n  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a\nhigh-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this\nsynthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of\nVLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object\ndetectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data\n(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than\nthese detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked\nimprovements, with their performance becoming comparable.\n  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means\nto bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of\nsynthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,\nscalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where\nreal data is scarce/impractical to obtain.\n  Project Page: https://synspill.vercel.app", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5de5\u4e1a\u6cc4\u6f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6SynSpill\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u6cc4\u6f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u53caYOLO\u3001DETR\u7b49\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636eSynSpill\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e0b\uff0cVLM\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5f7c\u6b64\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u6ca1\u6709\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0cVLM\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and\nstructured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints\nspecified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM\noutput is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has\nproposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to\nparticular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the\nemerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as\nthe generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address\nthis challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion\nmodels, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.\nWe begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive\ninfilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a\nvalid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the\npreviously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then\nreduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the\ntarget language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient\nalgorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various\napplications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in\nJSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness\nwhile consistently preserving or improving functional correctness.

LoRaWAN end devices are usually energy-constrained, and LoRaWAN\ntransmissions are subject to duty-cycle restrictions. Consequently, controlling\nthe energy expenditure and update-delivery latency of FUOTA are key challenges.\nWe propose a flexible scheme that achieves a tunable trade-off between the\nenergy consumption and delivery delay.

By adjusting\nthe smallest spreading factor to be used and the number of transmissions per\nspreading factor, a suitable energy-delay trade-off can be achieved.

The current work is an attempt to understand design neurocognition by\ncategorising the tasks and measuring the mental effort involved in these tasks\nusing EEG. The analysis is intended to validate design intervention tools to\nsupport the conceptual design involving motion exploration. A novel EEG-based\nmetric, inter-Band Relative Power Difference (inter-BRPD), is introduced to\nquantify mental effort.

However,\ncommercially available sensors usually exhibit non-linear and cross-reactive\nbehavior, contrary to the idealizing assumptions about linear and perfectly\nmolecule type-specific sensing often made in the MC literature.

Additionally, we introduce\nan algorithm for the design of mixture alphabets that accounts for the RX\ncharacteristics. We evaluate our detector and alphabet design algorithm through\nsimulations that are based on measurements reported for two commercial MOS\nsensors. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed detector achieves\nsimilar symbol error rates as data-driven methods without requiring large\nnumbers of training samples and that the alphabet design algorithm outperforms\nmethods that do not account for the RX characteristics.

In this context, larger attention weights may\nimply more relevant features for the model's prediction. In evidence-based\nmedicine, such explanations could support physicians' understanding and\ninteraction with AI systems used to categorize biomedical literature. However,\nthere is still no consensus on whether attention weights provide helpful\nexplanations. Moreover, little research has explored how visualizing attention\naffects its usefulness as an explanation aid. To bridge this gap, we conducted\na user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in\nbiomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to\nvisualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who\nclassified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad\nsynthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the\nTransformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the\nattention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the\npredictions.

We introduce EDAPT, a task- and\nmodel-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model\nadaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple\nusers, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as\nthe neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets\ncovering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over\nconventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining\npopulation-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised\ndomain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets.

The nature and criticality of\nfailures are often dependent on the context of the interaction and so cannot be\ngeneralized across the wide range of scenarios and experiments which have been\nimplemented in HRI research. In this work we propose the use of a technique\noverlooked in the field of HRI, ethnographic vignettes, to clearly highlight\nthese failures, particularly those that are rarely documented. We describe the\nmethodology behind the process of writing vignettes and create our own based on\nour personal experiences with failures in HRI systems. We emphasize the\nstrength of vignettes as the ability to communicate failures from a\nmulti-disciplinary perspective, promote transparency about the capabilities of\nrobots, and document unexpected behaviours which would otherwise be omitted\nfrom research reports. We encourage the use of vignettes to augment existing\ninteraction evaluation methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5efa\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528\u6c11\u65cf\u5fd7\u5c0f\u54c1\uff08ethnographic vignettes\uff09\u6765\u7a81\u51fa\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08HRI\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u4f46\u9c9c\u6709\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u89c6\u89d2\u4fc3\u8fdb\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u56e0\u60c5\u5883\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u63cf\u8ff0\u6c11\u65cf\u5fd7\u5c0f\u54c1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2a\u4eba\u5728HRI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u7ecf\u9a8c\u521b\u5efa\u5c0f\u54c1\u3002", "result": "\u5c0f\u54c1\u80fd\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5c55\u793a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bb0\u5f55\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u610f\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06\u5c0f\u54c1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8865\u5145\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
