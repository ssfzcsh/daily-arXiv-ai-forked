Although prior studies have examined task-specific applications, the\nphase-specific effects of LLM assistance on the efficiency of code review\nprocesses remain underexplored. This research investigates the effect of GPT on\nGitHub pull request (PR) workflows, with a focus on reducing resolution time,\noptimizing phase-specific performance, and assisting developers. We curated a\ndataset of 25,473 PRs from 9,254 GitHub projects and identified GPT-assisted\nPRs using a semi-automated heuristic approach that combines keyword-based\ndetection, regular expression filtering, and manual verification until\nachieving 95% labeling accuracy. We then applied statistical modeling,\nincluding multiple linear regression and Mann-Whitney U test, to evaluate\ndifferences between GPT-assisted and non-assisted PRs, both at the overall\nresolution level and across distinct review phases. Our research has revealed\nthat early adoption of GPT can substantially boost the effectiveness of the PR\nprocess, leading to considerable time savings at various stages. Our findings\nsuggest that GPT-assisted PRs reduced median resolution time by more than 60%\n(9 hours compared to 23 hours for non-assisted PRs). We discovered that\nutilizing GPT can reduce the review time by 33% and the waiting time before\nacceptance by 87%. Analyzing a sample dataset of 300 GPT-assisted PRs, we\ndiscovered that developers predominantly use GPT for code optimization (60%),\nbug fixing (26%), and documentation updates (12%). This research sheds light on\nthe impact of the GPT model on the code review process, offering actionable\ninsights for software teams seeking to enhance workflows and promote seamless\ncollaboration."}

However, implementing distributed tracing in\nlarge-scale applications remains challenging due to the need for extensive\ninstrumentation. To reduce this burden, zero-code instrumentation solutions,\nsuch as those based on eBPF, have emerged, allowing span data to be collected\nwithout modifying application code. Despite this promise, span correlation, the\nprocess of establishing causal relationships between spans, remains a critical\nchallenge in zero-code approaches.

The default Data Distribution Service (DDS) communication\nstack in ROS 2 exhibits significant performance degradation over lossy wireless\nlinks. Despite the widespread use of ROS 2, the underlying causes of these\nwireless communication challenges remain unexplored. In this paper, we present\nthe first in-depth network-layer analysis of ROS 2's DDS stack under wireless\nconditions with large payloads. We identify the following three key issues:\nexcessive IP fragmentation, inefficient retransmission timing, and congestive\nbuffer bursts. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight and fully\ncompatible DDS optimization framework that tunes communication parameters based\non link and payload characteristics. Our solution can be seamlessly applied\nthrough the standard ROS 2 application interface via simple XML-based QoS\nconfiguration, requiring no protocol modifications, no additional components,\nand virtually no integration efforts. Extensive experiments across various\nwireless scenarios demonstrate that our framework successfully delivers large\npayloads in conditions where existing DDS modes fail, while maintaining low\nend-to-end latency."}

The architecture enables both fine-grained\npartial ownership and integrated whole-asset ownership through a system of\ntwo-way convertibility.

In\ndeductive program synthesis, computer programming is phrased as a task in\ntheorem proving; a declarative specification is expressed in logical form and\npresented to an automatic theorem prover, and a program meeting the\nspecification is extracted from the proof. The correctness of the program is\nsupported by the proof, which also provides an explanation of how the program\nworks. The proof is conducted in an appropriate axiomatic subject-domain\ntheory, which defines the concepts in the specification and the constructs in\nthe target programming language and provides the background knowledge necessary\nto connect them.\n  For the unification proof, we generalize and automate the manual proof\npresented in Manna and Waldinger [1981]. The new program unifies two given\nsymbolic expressions (s-expressions) relative to a given \"environment\"\nsubstitution. The proof establishes the existence of an output substitution\nthat is a most-general idempotent unifier of the given expressions and is an\n\"extension\" of the environment substitution. If no such substitution exists and\nthe expressions are not unifiable, the program is to produce a failure\nindicator.\n  Initially the environment substitution is the empty substitution, which makes\nno replacements at all; during execution of recursive calls, the environment\nsubstitution records the replacements that have been found so far. Our own\nunification algorithm employs an environment, and such algorithms appear in the\nliterature [e.g., Luger and Stubblefield, 1997].

We draw on a dataset of over 450 human\ncreated games, created by participants who saw an initial seed set of\ntwo-player grid-based strategy games.
