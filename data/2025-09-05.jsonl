Keystroke- and line-level event logs have been used in the past in\nvarious ways, primarily in high-level descriptive statistics (e.g., timings,\ncharacter deletion rate, etc). Analysis of behavior in context (e.g., how much\ntime students spend working on loops) has been cumbersome because of our\ninability to automatically track high-level code representations, such as\nabstract syntax trees, through time and unparseable states.\n  Objective: Our study has two goals. The first is to design the first\nalgorithm that tracks parse tree nodes through time. Second, we utilize this\nalgorithm to perform a partial replication study of prior work that used manual\ntracking of code representations, as well as other novel analyses of student\nprogramming behavior that can now be done at scale.\n  Method: We use two algorithms presented in this paper to track parse tree\nnodes through time and construct tree representations for unparseable code\nstates. We apply these algorithms to a public keystroke data from student\ncoursework in a 2021 CS1 course and conduct analysis on the resulting parse\ntrees.\n  Findings: We discover newly observable statistics at scale, including that\ncode is deleted at similar rates inside and outside of conditionals and loops,\na third of commented out code is eventually restored, and that frequency with\nwhich students jump around in their code may not be indicative of struggle.\n  Implications: The ability to track parse trees through time opens the door to\nunderstanding new dimensions of student programming, such as best practices of\nstructural development of code over time, quantitative measurement of what\nsyntactic constructs students struggle most with, refactoring behavior, and\nattention shifting within the code."}

In addition\nto preserving the compositional semantics while computing system behaviors,\nalgorithms have to cater to the explosion in the number of locations in the\nparallel product automaton. In this paper, we propose a bounded reachability\nanalysis algorithm for compositional hybrid systems with piecewise affine\ndynamics, based on the principle of counterexample guided abstraction\nrefinement (CEGAR). In particular, the algorithm searches for a counterexample\nin the discrete abstraction of the composition model, without explicitly\ncomputing a product automaton. When a counterexample is discovered in the\nabstraction, its validity is verified by a refinement of the state-space guided\nby the abstract counterexample. The state-space refinement is through a\nsymbolic reachability analysis, particularly using a state-of-the-art algorithm\nwith support functions as the continuous state representation. In addition, the\nalgorithm mixes different semantics of composition with the objective of\nimproved efficiency. Step compositional semantics is followed while exploring\nthe abstract (discrete) state-space, while shallow compositional semantics is\nfollowed during state-space refinement with symbolic reachability analysis.\nOptimizations such as caching the results of the symbolic reachability\nanalysis, which can be later reused, have been proposed.

Despite the multitude\nof literature reviews on indoor positioning, a survey dedicated to FTM and its\nrecent enhancements has so far been lacking. We fill this gap by classifying\nand reviewing over 180 research papers related to the practical accuracy\nachieved with FTM, methods for improving its accuracy (also with machine\nlearning), combining FTM with other indoor positioning systems, FTM-based\napplications, and security issues. Based on the conducted survey, we summarize\nthe most important research achievements and formulate open areas for further\nresearch."}

This review paper provides\na concise yet comprehensive survey of real-time object detection (OD)\nalgorithms for autonomous cars delving into their hardware accelerators (HAs).\nNon-neural network-based algorithms, which use statistical image processing,\nhave been entirely substituted by AI algorithms, such as different models of\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs). Their intrinsically parallel features led\nthem to be deployable into edge-based HAs of various types, where GPUs and, to\na lesser extent, ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) remain the most\nwidely used. Throughputs of hundreds of frames/s (fps) could be reached;\nhowever, handling object detection for all the cameras available in a typical\nAV requires further hardware and algorithmic improvements. The intensive\ncompetition between AV providers has limited the disclosure of algorithms,\nfirmware, and even hardware platform details. This remains a hurdle for\nresearchers, as commercial systems provide valuable insights while academics\nundergo lengthy training and testing on restricted datasets and road scenarios.\nConsequently, many AV research papers may not be reflected in end products,\nbeing developed under limited conditions. This paper surveys state-of-the-art\nOD algorithms and aims to bridge the gap with technologies in commercial AVs.\nTo our knowledge, this aspect has not been addressed in earlier surveys.

The goal of\nthis task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and\nthe desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing\nresearch attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or\nconditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a\nlatent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite\nthe progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control,\nlimited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than\n``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this\npaper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new\nperspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i)\nhuman motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a\nbody-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and\nreason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently\ncompositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation\nvia effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an\nintermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a\nreasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion.\nOur method executes in the body-part text space with much higher\ninterpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving\npotential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to\nnew styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive\nexperiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized\nmotion generation."}

We\nstudy the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to\ninfinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the\nproperties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be\nstudied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one\nrelation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete\ncharacterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An\nMLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer\nk-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''\nfor first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer\nvertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis\nshows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit\nbehaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the\nsoft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It\nwill also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted\nBayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly\nmeaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with\nincreasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not\neven approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown\nthat on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost\nall its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible\nworlds than the uniform distribution does."}

Four key themes emerged: (1) the heterogeneity of workflows, (2)\nthe documentation burden is systemic and not directly linked to the creation of\nany single type of documentation, (3) the need for flexible tools and clinician\nautonomy, and (4) effective implementation requires mutual learning between\nclinicians and AI systems.\n  While LLMs show promise in easing documentation tasks, their success will\ndepend on flexible, adaptive integration that supports clinician autonomy.\nBeyond technical performance, sustained adoption will require training programs\nand implementation strategies that reflect the complexity of clinical\nenvironments."}

They can function as independent coaches or provide\nsupport alongside human coaches, and healthcare professionals. In coaching\ninteractions, these robots often handle sensitive information shared by users,\nmaking privacy a relevant issue. Despite this, little is known about the\nfactors that shape users' privacy perceptions. This research aims to examine\nthree key factors systematically: (1) the transparency about information usage,\n(2) the level of specific user control over how the robot uses their\ninformation, and (3) the robot's behavioral approach - whether it acts\nproactively or only responds on demand. Our results from an online study (N =\n200) show that even when users grant the robot general access to personal data,\nthey additionally expect the ability to explicitly control how that information\nis interpreted and shared during sessions. Experimental conditions that\nprovided such control received significantly higher ratings for perceived\nprivacy appropriateness and trust. Compared to user control, the effects of\ntransparency and proactivity on privacy appropriateness perception were low,\nand we found no significant impact. The results suggest that merely informing\nusers or proactive sharing is insufficient without accompanying user control.\nThese insights underscore the need for further research on mechanisms that\nallow users to manage robots' information processing and sharing, especially\nwhen social robots take on more proactive roles alongside humans."}

While automated red-teaming approaches\npromise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of\nmodel behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an\ninitial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in\nautomated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming,\nthat introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to\nexplore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first\nintroduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either \"red-teaming\nexpert\" personas or \"regular AI user\" personas. We then develop a dynamic\npersona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types\nadaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new\nmetrics to explicitly measure the \"mutation distance\" to complement existing\ndiversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising\nimprovements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts\nthrough persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to\nRainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method.

Existing studies acknowledge transparency as essential for trust,\nfairness, and engagement, yet its relationship with DX has not been\nsystematically conceptualized. Hence, this work aims to advance the\nunderstanding of transparency in SECO from a developer-centered perspective. To\nthis end, we propose SECO-TransDX (Transparency in Software Ecosystems from a\nDeveloper Experience Perspective), a conceptual model that introduces the\nnotion of DX-driven transparency. The model identifies 63 interrelated\nconcepts, including conditioning factors, ecosystem procedures, artifacts, and\nrelational dynamics that influence how transparency is perceived and\nconstructed during developer interactions. SECO-TransDX was built upon prior\nresearch and refined through a Delphi study with experts from academia and\nindustry.

However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,\npeople also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a\nsignificant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose\nidentities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%\nif people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if\npeople think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their\ndecisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances.
