On Psychological Safety and Social Learning in (Agile) Communities of Practice", "categories": ["cs.SE"], "comment": null, "summary": "As hybrid, distributed, and asynchronous work models become more prevalent,\ncontinuous learning in Agile Software Development (ASD) gains renewed\nimportance. Communities of Practice (CoPs) are increasingly adopted to support\nsocial learning beyond formal education, often relying on virtual\ncommunication. Psychological safety, a prerequisite for effective learning,\nremains insufficiently understood in these settings. This mixed-methods study\ninvestigates psychological safety within Agile CoPs through survey data from\n143 participants. Results indicate that psychological safety is significantly\nlower in online interactions compared to face-to-face settings. Moreover, low\npsychological safety reduces participants' intent to continue contributing and\navoidance of interpersonal risk. No significant differences emerged based on\ngender, community seniority, or content creation activity. However, differences\nby role and age group suggest potential generational or role-related effects.\nThematic analysis revealed exclusionary behavior, negative interaction\npatterns, and hostility as primary threats to psychological safety, often\nreinforced by tribalism and specific community dynamics. Suggested\ninterventions include establishing explicit norms, structured facilitation, and\nactive moderation. The findings were validated through member checking with 30\nparticipants. This study provides a comparative perspective on interaction\nmodalities and offers practical guidance for organizers seeking to cultivate\ninclusive, high-impact CoPs and similarly structured virtual or hybrid work\nenvironments."}

Since automated test generators inherently rely on frequent execution of\ncandidate tests, we make use of these frequent executions to address this\nproblem by introducing type tracing, which extracts type-related information\nduring execution and gradually refines the available type information. We\nimplement type tracing as an extension of the Pynguin test-generation framework\nfor Python, allowing it (i) to infer parameter types by observing how\nparameters are used during runtime, (ii) to record the types of values that\nfunction calls return, and (iii) to use this type information to increase code\ncoverage.

We introduce\nA LoD of Gaussians, a framework for training and rendering ultra-large-scale\nGaussian scenes on a single consumer-grade GPU -- without partitioning. Our\nmethod stores the full scene out-of-core (e.g., in CPU memory) and trains a\nLevel-of-Detail (LoD) representation directly, dynamically streaming only the\nrelevant Gaussians.

Although linear attention\nmechanisms have successfully reduced this burden in language models, our\ninitial experiments reveal that they significantly degrade image generation\nquality because of their inability to capture critical long-range dependencies\nin visual data. We propose Linear Attention with Spatial-Aware Decay (LASAD), a\nnovel attention mechanism that explicitly preserves genuine 2D spatial\nrelationships within the flattened image sequences by computing\nposition-dependent decay factors based on true 2D spatial location rather than\n1D sequence positions. Based on this mechanism, we present LASADGen, an\nautoregressive image generator that enables selective attention to relevant\nspatial contexts with linear complexity.

The system\nintegrates AI techniques, including visual focus determination using eye\ntracking, pupil dilation analysis, and computer vision; communication analysis\nthrough a maritime-specific speech-to-text model and natural language\nprocessing; communication correctness using large language models; and mental\nstress detection via vocal pitch. Models were evaluated on data from simulated\nmaritime scenarios with seafarers exposed to controlled high-stress events. The\nAI algorithms achieved high accuracy, with ~92% for visual detection, ~91% for\nmaritime speech recognition, and ~90% for stress detection, surpassing existing\nbenchmarks. The system provides insights into visual attention, adherence to\ncommunication checklists, and stress levels under demanding conditions. This\nstudy demonstrates how AI can transform maritime training by delivering\nobjective performance analytics, enabling personalized feedback, and improving\npreparedness for real-world operational challenges."}

However,\nexplaining the Shapley value of an owner in a data coalition is an unexplored\nand challenging task. To tackle this, we formulate the problem of finding the\ncounterfactual explanation of Shapley value in data coalitions. Essentially,\ngiven two data owners $A$ and $B$ such that $A$ has a higher Shapley value than\n$B$, a counterfactual explanation is a smallest subset of data entries in $A$\nsuch that transferring the subset from $A$ to $B$ makes the Shapley value of\n$A$ less than that of $B$. We show that counterfactual explanations always\nexist, but finding an exact counterfactual explanation is NP-hard. Using Monte\nCarlo estimation to approximate counterfactual explanations directly according\nto the definition is still very costly, since we have to estimate the Shapley\nvalues of owners $A$ and $B$ after each possible subset shift. We develop a\nseries of heuristic techniques to speed up computation by estimating\ndifferential Shapley values, computing the power of singular data entries, and\nshifting subsets greedily, culminating in the SV-Exp algorithm. Our\nexperimental results on real datasets clearly demonstrate the efficiency of our\nmethod and the effectiveness of counterfactuals in interpreting the Shapley\nvalue of an owner."}

With recent\nadvances in Large Language Models (LLMs), automatic adaptation of code can be\nachieved from high-level user prompts, reducing the barrier for visualization\nretargeting. To better understand how LLMs can assist retargeting and its\npotential limitations, we characterize and evaluate the performance of LLM\nassistance across multiple datasets and charts of varying complexity,\ncategorizing failures according to type and severity. In our evaluation, we\ncompare two approaches: (1) directly instructing the LLM model to fully\ngenerate and adapt code by treating code as text inputs and (2) a more\nconstrained program synthesis pipeline where the LLM guides the code\nconstruction process by providing structural information (e.g., visual\nencodings) based on properties of the example code and data.

Additionally, the analysis of blockchain security from an\neconomic and game theoretic perspective has been growing in popularity in\nrecent years. In this work, we present a surprising rational censorship attack\non blockchain censorship resilience when we adopt the analysis of blockchain\nsecurity from a game theoretic lens and assume all users are rational. In our\nattack, a colluding group with sufficient voting power censors the remainder\nnodes such that the group alone can gain all the rewards from maintaining the\nblockchain. We show that if nodes are rational, coordinating this attack just\nrequires a public read and write blackboard and we formally model the attack\nusing a game theoretic framework. Furthermore, we note that to ensure the\nsuccess of the attack, nodes need to know the total true voting power held by\nthe colluding group. We prove that the strategy to join the rational censorship\nattack and also for nodes to honestly declare their power is a subgame perfect\nequilibrium in the corresponding extensive form game induced by our attack.\nFinally, we discuss the implications of the attack on blockchain users and\nprotocol designers as well as some potential countermeasures."}

Using interval analysis, coupled with the computational power and\narchitecture of GPU, the method iteratively rules out the regions in the search\ndomain where the global minimum cannot exist and leaves a finite set of regions\nwhere the global minimum must exist. For effectiveness, because of the rigor of\ninterval analysis, the method is guaranteed to enclose the global minimum of\nthe nonlinear function even in the presence of rounding errors. For efficiency,\nthe method employs a novel GPU-based single program, single data parallel\nprogramming style to circumvent major GPU performance bottlenecks, and a\nvariable cycling technique is also integrated into the method to reduce\ncomputational cost when minimizing large-scale nonlinear functions. The method\nis validated by minimizing 10 multimodal benchmark test functions with scalable\ndimensions, including the well-known Ackley function, Griewank function, Levy\nfunction, and Rastrigin function. These benchmark test functions represent\ngrand challenges of global optimization, and enclosing the guaranteed global\nminimum of these benchmark test functions with more than 80 dimensions has not\nbeen reported in the literature.

This\nlimitation becomes particularly apparent in complex terrains. Obstacle\nnegotiation, a critical scenario exemplifying such challenges, requires both\nreal-time perception of obstacle geometry and responsiveness to user intention\nabout when and where to step over or onto, to dynamically adjust swing\ntrajectories. We propose a novel control strategy that fuses environmental\nawareness and human cooperativeness: an on-board depth camera detects obstacles\nahead of swing phase, prompting an elevated early-swing trajectory to ensure\nclearance, while late-swing control defers to natural biomechanical cues from\nthe user. This approach enables intuitive stepping strategies without requiring\nunnatural movement patterns. Experiments with three non-amputee participants\ndemonstrated 100 percent success across more than 150 step-overs and 30\nstep-ons with randomly placed obstacles of varying heights (4-16 cm) and\ndistances (15-70 cm).

When\nevaluating recommender systems, most studies focus on overall recommendation\nperformance. Only a few assess the quality of the explanations. Explanation\nquality is often evaluated through user studies that subjectively gather users'\nopinions on representative explanatory factors that shape end-users'\nperspective towards the results, not about the explanation contents itself. We\naim to fill this gap by developing an objective metric to evaluate Veracity:\nthe information quality of explanations. Specifically, we decompose Veracity\ninto two dimensions: Fidelity and Attunement. Fidelity refers to whether the\nexplanation includes accurate information about the recommended item.\nAttunement evaluates whether the explanation reflects the target user's\npreferences. By applying signal detection theory, we first determine decision\noutcomes for each dimension and then combine them to calculate a sensitivity,\nwhich serves as the final Veracity value. To assess the effectiveness of the\nproposed metric, we set up four cases with varying levels of information\nquality to validate whether our metric can accurately capture differences in\nquality. The results provided meaningful insights into the effectiveness of our\nproposed metric."}

Our extensive analysis\nshows that state-of-the-art LBMs achieve only marginal improvements (0.9%-1.2%)\nover traditional deep architectures while requiring significantly more\nparameters (millions vs thousands), raising important questions about their\nefficiency and applicability in BCI contexts. Moreover, through detailed\nablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we significantly reduce\ntrainable parameters without performance degradation, while demonstrating that\narchitectural and training inefficiencies limit LBMs' current capabilities. Our\nexperiments span both full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation\ntechniques, providing insights into optimal training strategies for BCI\napplications.
