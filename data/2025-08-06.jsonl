This\nlimitation stems from current architectures that conflate probabilistic,\nhigh-level planning with low-level action execution within a single generative\nprocess. To address this, we introduce the Source Code Agent framework, a new\nparadigm built on the \"Blueprint First, Model Second\" philosophy. Our framework\ndecouples the workflow logic from the generative model. An expert-defined\noperational procedure is first codified into a source code-based Execution\nBlueprint, which is then executed by a deterministic engine. The LLM is\nstrategically invoked as a specialized tool to handle bounded, complex\nsub-tasks within the workflow, but never to decide the workflow's path. We\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation on the challenging tau-bench benchmark,\ndesigned for complex user-tool-rule scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the\nSource Code Agent establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming the\nstrongest baseline by 10.1 percentage points on the average Pass^1 score while\ndramatically improving execution efficiency. Our work enables the verifiable\nand reliable deployment of autonomous agents in applications governed by strict\nprocedural logic."}

While profilers have been proven to be useful, they give\nextra burden to software engineers. Software engineers, as the users, are\nresponsible to interpret the complex performance data and identify actionable\noptimization in program source code. However, it can be challenging for users\nto associate inefficiencies with the program semantics, especially if the users\nare not the authors of the code, which limits the applicability of profilers.\n  In this thesis, we explore a new direction to combine performance profiles\nand program semantics with a deep learning approach. The key idea is to glean\ncode summary for semantic information (at a certain level) and integrate it\ninto a profiler, which can better understand program inefficiencies for\nactionable optimization. To be concrete, we combine profiles generated by Async\nProfiler (the state-of-the-art Java profiler) with code summarization from a\nfine-tuned CodeBERT-based model.

An expert-defined\noperational procedure is first codified into a source code-based Execution\nBlueprint, which is then executed by a deterministic engine. The LLM is\nstrategically invoked as a specialized tool to handle bounded, complex\nsub-tasks within the workflow, but never to decide the workflow's path. We\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation on the challenging tau-bench benchmark,\ndesigned for complex user-tool-rule scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the\nSource Code Agent establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming the\nstrongest baseline by 10.1 percentage points on the average Pass^1 score while\ndramatically improving execution efficiency. Our work enables the verifiable\nand reliable deployment of autonomous agents in applications governed by strict\nprocedural logic."}

A variety of off-the-shelf brake light\nassemblies are tested in a physical simulated driving environment to assess the\ncognitive reaction times of 22 subjects. Eight pairs of LED-based and two pairs\nof incandescent bulb-based brake light assemblies are used and\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) data recorded.

Existing optimization strategies for\ndeploying LLMs for diverse tasks focus on static scheduling, which requires\nextensive training data for performance prediction, increasing the\ncomputational costs and limiting the applicability and flexibility. In this\npaper, we propose the SmartLLMs Scheduler (SLS), a dynamic and cost-effective\nscheduling solution. The key idea is to learn LLMs' performance on diverse\ntasks and incorporate their real-time feedback to update strategies\nperiodically. Specifically, SLS incorporates three key components, including an\nAdaptive Cache Manager, a Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler, and a Dynamic\nUpdate Manager. The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed\nqueries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and\nminimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler\ndynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted\nperformance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific\nfeatures as input. The Update Manager continuously refines the cache and\nscheduling strategies based on real-time feedback from the assigned queries to\nenhance decision-making and adapt to evolving task characteristics. To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of SLS, we conduct extensive experiments on two LLM-based\nsoftware engineering tasks, including log parsing and code generation.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown\npromise by generating explanations of program structure and logic.

Second, retrieval inefficiency and attention saturation degrade\nperformance in RAG pipelines, where long, unaligned contexts overwhelm\nattention. Third, repository specific training data is scarce and often\noutdated. Finally, proprietary LLMs hinder industrial adoption due to privacy\nand deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose Key-Augmented\nNeural Triggers (KANT), a novel approach that embeds knowledge anchors into\nboth training and inference. Unlike prior methods, KANT enables internal access\nto repository specific knowledge, reducing fragmentation and grounding\ninference in localized context. Moreover, we synthesize specialized data\ndirectly from code. At inference, knowledge anchors replace verbose context,\nreducing token overhead and latency while supporting efficient, on premise\ndeployment. We evaluate KANT via: a qualitative human evaluation of the\nsynthesized dataset's intent coverage and quality across five dimensions;\ncompare against SOTA baselines across five qualitative dimensions and inference\nspeed; and replication across different LLMs to assess generalizability.\nResults show that the synthetic training data aligned with information-seeking\nneeds. KANT achieved over 60% preference from human annotators and a LocalStack\nexpert (preferring 79% of cases). Also, KANT reduced inference latency by up to\n85% across all models.

Online learning,\nsocial, and work activities, such as distance education, videoconferencing,\ninterviews, and talks, have led to a dramatic increase in speech-rich video\ncontent. In contrast to other video types, such as surveillance footage, which\ntypically contain abundant visual cues, speech-rich videos convey most of their\nmeaningful information through the audio channel. This poses challenges for\nimproving content consumption using existing visual-based video summarization,\nnavigation, and exploration systems. In this paper, we present VisAug, a novel\ninteractive system designed to enhance speech-rich video navigation and\nengagement by automatically generating informative and expressive visual\naugmentations based on the speech content of videos. Our findings suggest that\nthis system has the potential to significantly enhance the consumption and\nengagement of information in an increasingly video-driven digital landscape."}

While these problems can\nbe viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate\ncase of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This\ncontrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE),\nwhich require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that\nresponds to each action with a non-trivial observation.\n  To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this\ngeneral regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO)\nalgorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world\nsoftware engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on\nthe SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to\n39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches\nor outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and\nQwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward\nbuilding more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based\non open models."}

Leveraging theatrical methods, we use\nnarrative objectives to direct a puppeteer in generating improvised robotic\ngestures that convey specific emotions. These improvisations are captured and\ncurated to build a dataset of reusable movement templates for standalone\nplayback in future autonomous performances. Initial trials demonstrate the\nfeasibility of this approach, illustrating how the workflow enables precise\nsculpting of robotic gestures into coherent emotional arcs while revealing\nchallenges posed by the robot's mechanical constraints. We argue that this\npractice-led framework provides a model for interdisciplinary teams creating\nsocially expressive robot behaviours, contributing to (1) theatre as an\ninteractive training ground for human-robot interaction and (2) co-creation\nmethodologies between humans and machines."}

However, existing\nmethods struggle to leverage the semantic complementarity across different\ntypes of flows for representing program behaviors, and their context-unaware\nnature further hinders the accuracy of cross-flow semantic integration. We\npropose and implement MalFlows, a novel technique that achieves context-aware\nfusion of heterogeneous flow semantics for Android malware detection. Our goal\nis to leverage complementary strengths of the three types of flow-related\ninformation for precise app profiling. We adopt a heterogeneous information\nnetwork (HIN) to model the rich semantics across these program flows. We\nfurther propose flow2vec, a context-aware HIN embedding technique that\ndistinguishes the semantics of HIN entities as needed based on contextual\nconstraints across different flows and learns accurate app representations\nthrough the joint use of multiple meta-paths. The representations are finally\nfed into a channel-attention-based deep neural network for malware\nclassification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to\ncomprehensively aggregate the strengths of diverse flow-related information for\nassessing maliciousness within apps. We evaluate MalFlows on a large-scale\ndataset comprising over 20 million flow instances extracted from more than\n31,000 real-world apps. Experimental results demonstrate that MalFlows\noutperforms representative baselines in Android malware detection, and\nmeanwhile, validate the effectiveness of flow2vec in accurately learning app\nrepresentations from the HIN constructed over the heterogeneous flows."}
