The efficiency of distributed\ntraining crucially depends on the efficiency of the network interconnecting\nGPUs in the cluster. These networks are commonly built using RDMA following a\nClos-like datacenter topology. To efficiently utilize the network bandwidth,\nload balancing is employed to distribute traffic across multiple redundant\npaths. While there exists numerous techniques for load-balancing in traditional\ndatacenters, these are often either optimized for TCP traffic or require\nspecialized network hardware, thus limiting their utility in AI clusters.\n  This paper presents the design and evaluation of Hopper, a new load-balancing\ntechnique optimized for RDMA traffic in AI clusters. Operating entirely at the\nhost level, Hopper requires no specialized hardware or modifications to network\nswitches. It continuously monitors the current path for congestion and\ndynamically switches traffic to a less congested path when congestion is\ndetected. Furthermore, it incorporates a lightweight mechanism to identify\nalternative paths and carefully controls the timing of path switching to\nprevent excessive out-of-order packets.\n  We evaluated Hopper using ns-3 simulations and a testbed implementation.

Additionally, an on-chip\npseudo-random number generator and a unified on-the-fly twiddle factor\ngenerator significantly reduce memory demands, while optimized task scheduling\nenhances the CKKS client-side processing, achieving reduced latency. Overall,\nABC-FHE occupies a die area of 28.638 mm2 and consumes 5.654 W of power in 28\nnm technology.

Passive optical networks (PONs) have become a\nresearch hotspot due to their characteristics of low loss, high bandwidth, and\nlow cost. However, the traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA-PON) has\ndifficulty meeting the requirements of the next-generation PON for high\nspectral efficiency and flexibility. In this paper, a novel transmission\ntechnology, namely power-domain sparse dimension constellation multiple access\n(PD-SDCMA), is proposed for the first time. Through the signal space dimension\nselection strategy (S2D-strategy) in the high-dimensional signal space, the\nlow-dimensional constellation is sparsely superimposed into the\nhigh-dimensional space, thereby reducing multi-user interference and enhancing\nthe system capacity.

However, ensuring reliable, high-throughput, and low-latency 5G\ncommunication in aerial applications remains a critical and underexplored\nproblem. This paper presents the 5th generation (5G) Aero, a compact UAV\noptimized for 5G connectivity, aimed at fulfilling stringent 3rd Generation\nPartnership Project (3GPP) requirements. We conduct a set of experiments in an\nindoor environment, evaluating the UAV's ability to establish high-throughput,\nlow-latency communications in both Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-Line-of-Sight\n(NLoS) conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the 5G Aero meets the required\n3GPP standards for Command and Control (C2) packets latency in both LoS and\nNLoS, and video latency in LoS communications and it maintains acceptable\nlatency levels for video transmission in NLoS conditions. Additionally, we show\nthat the 5G module installed on the UAV introduces a negligible 1% decrease in\nflight time, showing that 5G technologies can be integrated into commercial\noff-the-shelf UAVs with minimal impact on battery lifetime. This paper\ncontributes to the literature by demonstrating the practical capabilities of\ncurrent 5G networks to support advanced UAV operations in telecommunications,\noffering insights into potential enhancements and optimizations for UAV\nperformance in 5G networks", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e865G Aero\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a5G\u8fde\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u8ddd\u548c\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7b26\u54083GPP\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u4fdd5G\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u89c6\u8ddd\u548c\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u6b3e\u7d27\u51d1\u578b5G\u65e0\u4eba\u673a5G Aero\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5176\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u8ddd\u548c\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u4e0b\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "5G Aero\u5728\u89c6\u8ddd\u548c\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u6ee1\u8db33GPP\u6807\u51c6\uff1b5G\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u98de\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\uff08\u4ec51%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u524d5G\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u9ad8\u7ea7\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u57285G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

We propose gradual metaprogramming\nto (1) provide a migration path toward statically typed DSLs, (2) immediately\nprovide earlier detection of code generation type errors, and (3) report the\nsource code location responsible for the type error.

RAN slicing and the O-RAN paradigm are considered game changers\nin TNs, where the former makes it possible to tailor user services to users\nrequirements, and the latter brings openness and intelligence to the management\nof the RAN. In TNs, bandwidth scarcity requires a dynamic bandwidth slicing\nstrategy. Although this type of strategy ensures efficient bandwidth\nutilization, it compromises RAN slicing isolation in terms of quality of\nservice (QoS) performance. To deal with this challenge, we propose a deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL)-based RAN slicing mechanism that achieves a\ntrade-off between efficient RAN bandwidth sharing and appropriate inter- and\nintra-slice isolation. The proposed mechanism performs bandwidth allocation in\ntwo stages. In the first stage, the bandwidth is allocated to the RAN slices.\nIn the second stage, each slice partitions its bandwidth among its associated\nusers. In both stages, the slicing operation is constrained by several\nconsiderations related to improving the QoS of slices and users that in turn\nfoster inter- and intra-slice isolation. The proposed RAN slicing mechanism is\nbased on DRL algorithms to perform the bandwidth sharing operation in each\nstage. We propose to deploy the mechanism in an O-RAN architecture and describe\nthe O-RAN functional blocks and the main DRL model lifecycle management phases\ninvolved.

Traditional countermeasures, such as masking, face\nchallenges including complex integration during synthesis, substantial area\noverhead, and susceptibility to optimization removal during logic synthesis. To\naddress these issues, we introduce PoSyn, a novel logic synthesis framework\ndesigned to enhance cryptographic hardware resistance against PSC attacks. Our\nmethod centers on optimal bipartite mapping of vulnerable RTL components to\nstandard cells from the technology library, aiming to minimize PSC leakage. By\nutilizing a cost function integrating critical characteristics from both the\nRTL design and the standard cell library, we strategically modify mapping\ncriteria during RTL-to-netlist conversion without altering design\nfunctionality. Furthermore, we theoretically establish that PoSyn minimizes\nmutual information leakage, strengthening its security against PSC\nvulnerabilities. We evaluate PoSyn across various cryptographic hardware\nimplementations, including AES, RSA, PRESENT, and post-quantum cryptographic\nalgorithms such as Saber and CRYSTALS-Kyber, at technology nodes of 65nm, 45nm,\nand 15nm. Experimental results demonstrate a substantial reduction in success\nrates for Differential Power Analysis (DPA) and Correlation Power Analysis\n(CPA) attacks, achieving lows of 3% and 6%, respectively. TVLA analysis further\nconfirms that synthesized netlists exhibit negligible leakage.

Second, multimodal data\nare collected during learning activities, including video recordings, audio\ncapture, gaze tracking, physiological signals (heart rate, motion data), and\nbehavioral interactions.

Traditional\nremedies such as global model regularization or layer freezing either incur\nhigh computational costs or struggle to adapt to feature shifts. In this work,\nwe propose UniVarFL, a novel FL framework that emulates IID-like training\ndynamics directly at the client level, eliminating the need for global model\ndependency. UniVarFL leverages two complementary regularization strategies\nduring local training: Classifier Variance Regularization, which aligns\nclass-wise probability distributions with those expected under IID conditions,\neffectively mitigating local classifier bias; and Hyperspherical Uniformity\nRegularization, which encourages a uniform distribution of feature\nrepresentations across the hypersphere, thereby enhancing the model's ability\nto generalize under diverse data distributions. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that UniVarFL outperforms existing\nmethods in accuracy, highlighting its potential as a highly scalable and\nefficient solution for real-world FL deployments, especially in\nresource-constrained settings.

Recent work has increasingly\nutilized large language models (LLMs) to generate test cases, improving the\nquality of test generation by providing better context and correcting errors in\nthe model's output. However, these methods rely on fixed prompts, resulting in\nrelatively low compilation success rates and coverage. This paper presents\nPALM, an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance the\ngeneration of high-coverage unit tests. PALM performs program analysis to\nidentify branching conditions within functions, which are then combined into\npath constraints. These constraints and relevant contextual information are\nused to construct prompts that guide the LLMs in generating unit tests.
