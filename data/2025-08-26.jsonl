Existing syntax error recovery techniques, like\npanic mode and multi-option repairs, are either too coarse, e.g. in deleting\nlarge swathes of code, or lead to a proliferation of possible completions. This\npaper introduces $\\texttt{tylr}$, a parser and editor generator that completes\narbitrarily malformed code by inserting obligations, which generalize holes to\ncover missing operands, operators, mixfix keywords, and sort transitions.\n$\\texttt{tylr}$ is backed by a novel theory of tile-based parsing, which\nextends operator-precedence parsing in two ways. First, traditional token\nprecedence comparisons are replaced by a notion of grammar walks, which form\nthe basis for generating obligations. Second, a distinct \"molding\" system based\non grammar zippers expand grammar expressivity by allowing the system to\ndisambiguate between possible parses and completions based on an obligation\nminimization criterion. In addition to serving as a novel approach to error\ncorrection, $\\texttt{tylr}$'s design enables the development of an editor that\nvisually materializes obligations to the human user, serving as a novel hybrid\nbetween a text editor and a structure editor. We introduce $\\texttt{tylr}$ by\nexample, then formalize its key ideas. Finally, we conduct a human subjects\nstudy to evaluate the extent to which an editor like $\\texttt{tylr}$ that\nmaterializes syntactic obligations might be usable and useful, finding both\npoints of positivity and interesting new avenues for future work."}

We\nperform extensive Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) exercises to\nevaluate the bitcell footprint for different cell configurations at a\nrepresentative 7 nm technology and to assess their implications on read and\nwrite power-performance. We crucially identify the MTJ routing struggle in\nconventional two-transistor one-resistor (2T1R) SOT-MRAMs as the primary\nbitcell area scaling challenge and propose to use BEOL read selectors (BEOL\nRSs) that enable (10 -- 40) % bitcell area reduction and eventually match\nsub-N3 SRAM. On writability, we affirm that BEOL RS-based bitcells could meet\nthe required SOT switching current, provided the magnetic free layer properties\nbe engineered in line with LLC-specific, (0.1 -- 100) s retention targets. This\nis particularly to attribute to their (i) more available Si fins for write\ntransistor and (ii) lower bitline resistance at reduced cell width. We\nnevertheless underscore the read tradeoff associated with BEOL RSs, with the\nlow-drive IGZO-FET selector sacrificing the latency up to (3 -- 5) ns and the\nimperfectly rectifying diode selectors suffering (2.5 -- 5)$\\times$ energy cost\nrelative to 2T1R. This article thus highlights the realistic prospects and\nhurdles of BEOL RSs towards holistic power-performance-area scaling of\nSOT-MRAM."}

As a general rule, CodeLLMs are trained by dividing training\nexamples into input tokens and then learn importance of those tokens in a\nprocess called machine attention. Machine attention is based solely on input\ntoken salience to output token examples during training. Human software\ndevelopers are different, as humans intuitively know that some tokens are more\nsalient than others. While intuition itself is ineffable and a subject of\nphilosophy, clues about salience are present in human visual attention, since\npeople tend to look at more salient words more often. In this paper, we present\nEyeMulator, a technique for training CodeLLMs to mimic human visual attention\nwhile training for various software development tasks. We add special weights\nfor each token in each input example to the loss function used during LLM\nfine-tuning. We draw these weights from observations of human visual attention\nderived from a previously-collected publicly-available dataset of eye-tracking\nexperiments in software engineering tasks. These new weights ultimately induce\nchanges in the attention of the subject LLM during training, resulting in a\nmodel that does not need eye-tracking data during inference.

To achieve this goal,\nwe first construct DanceRemix, a large-scale multi-turn editable dance dataset\ncomprising the prompt featuring over 25.3M dance frames and 84.5K pairs. In\naddition, we propose a novel framework for iterative and editable dance\ngeneration coherently aligned with given music signals, namely DanceEditor.\nConsidering the dance motion should be both musical rhythmic and enable\niterative editing by user descriptions, our framework is built upon a\nprediction-then-editing paradigm unifying multi-modal conditions.

Specifically, CEM\nadaptively integrates the initial prediction with music and text prompts as\ntemporal motion cues to guide the synthesized sequences.

In fact, they can be useful even for fully formally verified tools, by\nexercising the parts of a complex system that go beyond the reach of formal\nmodels.\n  In this context, this paper introduces BCC: a model-based testing technique\nfor the Boogie intermediate verifier. BCC combines the formalization of a\nsmall, deterministic subset of the Boogie language with the generative\ncapabilities of the PLT Redex language engineering framework. Basically, BCC\nuses PLT Redex to generate random Boogie programs, and to execute them\naccording to a formal operational semantics; then, it runs the same programs\nthrough the Boogie verifier. Any inconsistency between the two executions (in\nPLT Redex and with Boogie) may indicate a potential bug in Boogie's\nimplementation.\n  To understand whether BCC can be useful in practice, we used it to generate\nthree million Boogie programs. These experiments found 2% of cases indicative\nof completeness failures (i.e., spurious verification failures) in Boogie's\ntoolchain.

We provide a detailed\nanatomical overview of each CPU's function call-chains and present how gem5\npartitions its execution time for each simulated hardware layer.\n  We perform our analysis using a lightweight profiler built on Linux's\nperf_event interface, with user-configurable options to target specific\nfunctions and examine their interactions in detail. By profiling each CPU\nacross a wide selection of benchmarks, we identify their software bottlenecks.\nOur results show that the Ruby memory subsystem consistently accounts for the\nlargest share of execution time in the sequential AS and TS CPUs, primarily\nduring the instruction fetch stage.

To make sure that the data replicas are\nup-to-date, they need to synchronize, which typically means engaging the\nreplicas in waiting for coherent responses from each other. The amount of\nwaiting depends on the consistency and availability guarantees we impose on the\nsystem. The folklore CAP theory states that strong consistency (the set of\nreplicas create an illusion of one correct server) and strong availability (the\nreplicas' states are reachable despite network partitions) cannot be\nimplemented in the same system. A popular way to deal with this impossibility\nis to relax consistency to be only eventual: the replicas eventually converge\nto the same state. In return, the replicas can be wait-free, i.e., the clients\ncan get the data from the closest replica without waiting for other ones.\n  Wait-free data replication faces two important challenges. First, the\noperations issued by the clients may be constantly revoked, i.e., their effects\ncan be repeatedly recomputed due to asynchrony and concurrency. Second, even if\nsome operations eventually stabilize in their effects, a particular client may\nstill experience starvation if, from some point onward, each of its operations\nis later revoked. In this paper, we address these challenges through a general\nDAG-based framework for replicated data types, where replicas exchange their\nlocal views and merge them using a reconciliation function.

Given the repetitive nature\nof daily commutes, they often feel bored and turn to electronic devices for\nentertainment.

Variability, implemented via\npre-processor directives (e.g., #ifdef blocks) interleaved with other code and\nspread across files, complicates maintenance and increases error risk. Despite\nits importance, little is known about how variable code is distributed among\ndevelopers or whether conventional expertise metrics adequately capture\nvariable code proficiency. This study investigates developers' engagement with\nvariable versus mandatory code, the concentration of variable code workload,\nand the effectiveness of expertise metrics in CSS projects. We mined\nrepositories of 25 CSS projects, analyzing 450,255 commits from 9,678\ndevelopers. Results show that 59% of developers never modified variable code,\nwhile about 17% were responsible for developing and maintaining 83% of it. This\nindicates a high concentration of variable code expertise among a few\ndevelopers, suggesting that task assignments should prioritize these\nspecialists. Moreover, conventional expertise metrics performed\npoorly--achieving only around 55% precision and 50% recall in identifying\ndevelopers engaged with variable code.

A vast yet underutilized resource for enhancing this alignment is\nthe extensive user feedback inherent in RSs. However, directly leveraging such\nfeedback presents two significant challenges. First, user feedback in RSs is\noften ambiguous and noisy, which negatively impacts effective preference\nalignment. Second, the massive volume of feedback largely hinders the\nefficiency of preference alignment, necessitating an efficient filtering\nmechanism to identify more informative samples. To overcome these hurdles, we\nintroduce a novel data construction framework that leverages user feedback in\nRSs with advanced LLM capabilities to generate high-quality simulation data.\nOur framework unfolds in two key phases: (1) employing LLMs to generate\ncognitive decision-making processes on constructed simulation samples, reducing\nambiguity in raw user feedback; (2) data distillation based on uncertainty\nestimation and behavior sampling to filter challenging yet denoised simulation\nsamples.

We evaluate four state-of-the-art ASR systems on eight publicly\navailable datasets that capture six dimensions of difficulty: domain-specific,\naccented, noisy, age-variant, impaired, and spontaneous speech. Our analysis\ndemonstrates significant variations in performance, hallucination tendencies,\nand inherent biases, despite similar scores on standard benchmarks. These\nlimitations have serious implications for HRI, where recognition errors can\ninterfere with task performance, user trust, and safety."}

This study investigates citizen satisfaction with the e-government\nservices in Saudi Arabia through a quality-in-use framework based on ISO/IEC\n25010 and ISO/IEC 25022 standards, interpreted through the lens of the Unified\nTheory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). A structured questionnaire\nwas administered to 500 citizens, yielding 276 valid responses. Satisfaction\nwas evaluated across four dimensions: overall satisfaction, feature\nsatisfaction, trust, and emotional engagement (pleasure). The findings\ndemonstrate consistently high levels of satisfaction regarding usability and\ntrust, aligning with Saudi Arabia's top-tier global ranking in e-government\ndevelopment. However, the results also highlight persistent challenges related\nto service clarity and system responsiveness. Emotional engagement was limited,\nindicating that users perceive these services primarily as functional tools\nrather than as engaging digital experiences. The study offers valuable insights\nfor policymakers and contributes to the theoretical integration of\nstandards-based and behavioral adoption models in the context of citizenship."}

This passivity creates\nan \"awareness gap,\" limiting their potential as truly collaborative partners in\ndynamic human discussions. We introduce $\\textit{DiscussLLM}$, a framework\ndesigned to bridge this gap by training models to proactively decide not just\n$\\textit{what}$ to say, but critically, $\\textit{when}$ to speak. Our primary\ncontribution is a scalable two-stage data generation pipeline that synthesizes\na large-scale dataset of realistic multi-turn human discussions. Each\ndiscussion is annotated with one of five intervention types (e.g., Factual\nCorrection, Concept Definition) and contains an explicit conversational trigger\nwhere an AI intervention adds value. By training models to predict a special\nsilent token when no intervention is needed, they learn to remain quiet until a\nhelpful contribution can be made. We explore two architectural baselines: an\nintegrated end-to-end model and a decoupled classifier-generator system\noptimized for low-latency inference. We evaluate these models on their ability\nto accurately time interventions and generate helpful responses, paving the way\nfor more situationally aware and proactive conversational AI."}

Such AI-based\nCV systems are becoming prevalent, with applications spanning from medical\nimaging to surveillance. State of the art models such as convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) are often regarded as ``black\nboxes,'' offering limited transparency into their decision-making processes.\nDespite a recent advancement in explainable AI (XAI), explainability remains\nunderutilized in practical CV deployments. A primary obstacle is the absence of\nintegrated software solutions that connect XAI techniques with robust knowledge\nmanagement and monitoring frameworks. To close this gap, we have developed Obz\nAI, a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to facilitate state-of-the-art\nexplainability and observability for vision AI systems. Obz AI provides a\nseamless integration pipeline, from a Python client library to a full-stack\nanalytics dashboard. With Obz AI, a machine learning engineer can easily\nincorporate advanced XAI methodologies, extract and analyze features for\noutlier detection, and continuously monitor AI models in real time. By making\nthe decision-making mechanisms of deep models interpretable, Obz AI promotes\nobservability and responsible deployment of computer vision systems."}
