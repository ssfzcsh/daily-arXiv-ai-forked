This work presents CoRe,\na high-quality, human-verified benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on\nfundamental static analysis tasks. CoRe includes 12,553 task instances spanning\ndata dependency, control dependency, and information flow across programs\nwritten in C/C++, Java, and Python. To ensure semantic diversity and reasoning\ncomplexity, we propose a semantics-aware diverse sampling strategy that selects\ntargets and task instances based on structural coverage and dependency depth.\nWe evaluate 10 mainstream LLMs and show that, while they perform well at\nidentifying dependencies, models still struggle with tasks that require deeper\nsemantic understanding and multi-step reasoning.

To control\ntheir propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active\ntopic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD\nmethods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in\nreal-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models\ntrained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this\nissue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative,\ninducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by\ntwo major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the\ndetection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second,\nthe social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the\ngeneralization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to\nremember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific\nparameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and\nanticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time\ndynamics model. Accordingly, we induce a new continual MMD method DAEDCMD.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that DAEDCMD can consistently and\nsignificantly outperform the compared methods, including six MMD baselines and\nthree continual learning methods."}

In\na spreadsheets, pivot tables offer a convenient way to summarize tabular data\nby computing aggregates over some attributes, grouped by others. However,\nidentifying attribute combinations that will result in useful pivot tables\nremains a challenge, especially for high-dimensional datasets. We formalize the\nproblem of automatically recommending insightful and interpretable pivot\ntables, eliminating the tedious manual process. A crucial aspect of\nrecommending a set of pivot tables is to diversify them. Traditional works\ninadequately address the table-diversification problem, which leads us to\nconsider the problem of pivot table diversification.\n  We present SAGE, a data-semantics-aware system for recommending k-budgeted\ndiverse pivot tables, overcoming the shortcomings of prior work for top-k\nrecommendations that cause redundancy. SAGE ensures that each pivot table is\ninsightful, interpretable, and adaptive to the user's actions and preferences,\nwhile also guaranteeing that the set of pivot tables are different from each\nother, offering a diverse recommendation. We make two key technical\ncontributions: (1) a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a\nsingle pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and (2) a\nscalable greedy algorithm that can efficiently select a set of diverse pivot\ntables of high utility, by leveraging data semantics to significantly reduce\nthe combinatorial search space. Our extensive experiments on three real-world\ndatasets show that SAGE outperforms alternative approaches, and efficiently\nscales to accommodate high-dimensional datasets.

As HPC infrastructures scale to\nsupport increasingly complex workloads-including generative AI-the need for\nefficient, reliable, and interoperable telemetry analysis becomes critical.\nOperational Data Analytics (ODA) has emerged to address these demands; however,\nthe reliance on schema-less storage solutions limits data accessibility and\nsemantic integration. Ontologies and knowledge graphs (KG) provide an effective\nway to enable efficient and expressive data querying by capturing domain\nsemantics, but they face challenges such as significant storage overhead and\nthe limited applicability of existing ontologies, which are often tailored to\nspecific HPC systems only. In this paper, we present the first unified ontology\nfor ODA in HPC systems, designed to enable semantic interoperability across\nheterogeneous data centers. Our ontology models telemetry data from the two\nlargest publicly available ODA datasets-M100 (Cineca, Italy) and F-DATA\n(Fugaku, Japan)-within a single data model. The ontology is validated through\n36 competency questions reflecting real-world stakeholder requirements, and we\nintroduce modeling optimizations that reduce knowledge graph (KG) storage\noverhead by up to 38.84% compared to a previous approach, with an additional\n26.82% reduction depending on the desired deployment configuration.

However, these methods often treat models as isolated\nblack boxes - relying on single-pass outputs without iterative refinement or\ncollaboration, limiting robustness and adaptability. Objective: We propose\nthat, just as human debates enhance accuracy and reduce bias in RE tasks by\nincorporating diverse perspectives, different LLM agents debating and\ncollaborating may achieve similar improvements. Our goal is to investigate\nwhether Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) strategies can enhance RE performance. Method:\nWe conducted a systematic study of existing MAD strategies across various\ndomains to identify their key characteristics. To assess their applicability in\nRE, we implemented and tested a preliminary MAD-based framework for RE\nclassification.

However, given the expensive measurements, large configuration\nspace, and rugged configuration landscape, existing tuners suffer\nineffectiveness due to the difficult balance of budget utilization between\nexploring uncertain regions (for escaping from local optima) and exploiting\nguidance of known good configurations (for fast convergence). The root cause is\nthat we lack knowledge of where the promising regions lay, which also causes\nchallenges in the explainability of the results.\n  In this paper, we propose PromiseTune that tunes configuration guided by\ncausally purified rules. PromiseTune is unique in the sense that we learn\nrules, which reflect certain regions in the configuration landscape, and purify\nthem with causal inference. The remaining rules serve as approximated\nreflections of the promising regions, bounding the tuning to emphasize these\nplaces in the landscape. This, as we demonstrate, can effectively mitigate the\nimpact of the exploration and exploitation trade-off.
