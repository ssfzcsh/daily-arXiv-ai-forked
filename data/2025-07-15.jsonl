In this\ncontext, various formats of collaborative development workflows using Git have\nemerged and gained popularity among software engineers. We can categorize such\nworkflows into two main types: branch-based workflows and trunk-based\nworkflows. Branch-based workflows typically define a set of remote branches\nwith well-defined objectives, such as feature branches, a branch for feature\nintegration, and a main branch. The goal is to migrate changes from the most\nisolated branch to the main one shared by all as the code matures. In this\ncategory, GitFlow stands out as the most popular example. In contrast,\ntrunk-based workflows have a single remote branch where developers integrate\ntheir changes directly. In this range of options, choosing a workflow that\nmaximizes team productivity while promoting software quality becomes a\nnon-trivial task. Despite discussions on forums, social networks, and blogs,\nfew scientific articles have explored this topic. In this work, we provide\nevidence on how Brazilian developers work with Git workflows and what factors\nfavor or hinder the use of each model. To this end, we conducted\nsemi-structured interviews and a survey with software developers. Our results\nindicate that trunk-based development favors fast-paced projects with\nexperienced and smaller teams, while branch-based development suits less\nexperienced and larger teams better, despite posing management challenges."}

Existing tools typically aim at managing control flow\ninternally, often at the expense of completeness, while offloading reasoning\nover data flow to SMT solvers. Moreover, reasoning typically happens on source\ncode or intermediate representation level to leverage structural information,\nmaking machine code generation part of the trust base. We are interested in\nchanging the equation in two non-trivial ways: pushing reasoning down to\nmachine code level, and then offloading reasoning entirely into SMT solvers and\nother, possibly more efficient solver technology. In more abstract terms, we\nare asking if bit-precise reasoning technology can be made scalable on\nsoftware, and not just hardware. For this purpose, we developed two tools\ncalled rotor and bitme for model generation and bounded model checking,\nrespectively. We chose RISC-V restricted to integer arithmetic as modeling\ntarget for rotor since RISC-V integer semantics is essentially equivalent to\nestablished SMT semantics over bitvectors and arrays of bitvectors. While\nstate-of-the-art SMT solvers struggle in our experiments, we have evidence that\nthere is potential for improvement. To show the potential, we have slightly\ngeneralized and then implemented in bitme two types of binary decision diagrams\n(BDDs): algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs) and context-free-language ordered\nbinary decision diagrams (CFLOBDDs). Bitme uses BDDs to propagate program input\nthrough models, essentially generalizing constant propagation to domain\npropagation. SMT solvers only get involved when model input cannot be\npropagated, significanly speeding up SMT solving.

In\nthe proposed framework, a set of controlled UAVs cooperatively estimate the\nreal-time 3D position of a target UAV. Here, the active UAV transmits a\nmeasurement signal to the passive UAVs via the reflection from the target UAV.\nEach passive UAV estimates the distance of the active-target-passive UAV link\nand selects an antenna port to share the distance information with the base\nstation (BS) that calculates the real-time position of the target UAV. As the\ntarget UAV is moving due to its task operation, the controlled UAVs must\noptimize their trajectories and select optimal antenna port, aiming to estimate\nthe real-time position of the target UAV. We formulate this problem as an\noptimization problem to minimize the target UAV positioning error via\noptimizing the trajectories of all controlled UAVs and antenna port selection\nof passive UAVs. Here, an attention-based recurrent multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (AR-MARL) scheme is proposed, which enables each controlled UAV to use\nthe local Q function to determine its trajectory and antenna port while\noptimizing the target UAV positioning performance without knowing the\ntrajectories and antenna port selections of other controlled UAVs. Different\nfrom current MARL methods, the proposed method uses a recurrent neural network\n(RNN) that incorporates historical state-action pairs of each controlled UAV,\nand an attention mechanism to analyze the importance of these historical\nstate-action pairs, thus improving the global Q function approximation accuracy\nand the target UAV positioning accuracy. Simulation results show that the\nproposed AR-MARL scheme can reduce the average positioning error by up to 17.5%\nand 58.5% compared to the VD-MARL scheme and the proposed method without FAS."}

To this end, the eBPF toolchain includes a verifier, which\nstatically checks safety properties such as memory access validity, bounded\nloops, and type correctness before loading the program into the kernel.\nHowever, the existing verifier is both overly conservative in some\ncases-rejecting valid programs-and unsound in others, permitting unsafe\nbehavior that violates the intended semantics of the kernel interface.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce BeePL, a domain-specific language\nfor eBPF with a formally verified type system. The BeePL type system, along\nwith the language design, statically enforces key safety properties such as\ntype-correct memory access, safe pointer usage, absence of unbounded loops, and\nstructured control flow. These guarantees are backed by formal type soundness\nproofs, ensuring that well-typed programs satisfy the safety invariants\nrequired by the eBPF execution environment. BeePL also proves that well-typed\nsource programs meet critical eBPF-specific properties related to memory\nsafety, termination, and control flow, enabling high-level reasoning prior to\ncompilation. For properties not fully enforceable statically-such as dynamic\nbounds and undefined behavior-BeePL inserts semantics-preserving runtime checks\nduring compilation. We develop a verified compilation strategy that extends\nCompCert to generate BPF bytecode from BeePL programs, establishing a\nprincipled foundation for an end-to-end verifiable toolchain for safe kernel\nextensions."}

We propose SLIM, an algorithm-hardware co-design optimized for\nsparse LLM serving on edge devices. SLIM exploits LLM sparsity through an\nadaptive thresholding algorithm that enables runtime-configurable sparsity with\nnegligible accuracy loss, fetching only activated neurons to dramatically\nreduce data movement. Our heterogeneous hardware architecture strategically\ncombines near-storage processing (NSP) and processing-in-memory (PIM): FFN\nweights are stored in high-density 3D NAND and computed using NSP units, while\nmemory-intensive MHA operations are processed in PIM modules. This design\nsignificantly reduces memory footprint, data movement, and energy consumption.\nOur comprehensive evaluation demonstrates SLIM's effectiveness, achieving\n13-18x throughput improvements over SSD-GPU systems and 9-10x better energy\nefficiency over DRAM-GPU systems while maintaining low latency, making\ncost-effective LLM deployment viable for edge computing environments."}

Recent works have attempted to automate\nthis process with small transformer-based models and handcrafted CAD sequence\nrepresentations. However, there has been little effort to leverage the\npotential of large language models (LLMs) for sequential CAD design. In this\nwork, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of more than 170k CAD models\nannotated with high-quality, human-like descriptions generated with our\npipeline based on GPT-4.1. Using this dataset, we fine-tune powerful code-LLMs\nto generate CAD sequences represented in a JSON-based format from natural\nlanguage descriptions, demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of this\napproach for text-conditioned CAD generation. Because simple metrics often fail\nto reflect the quality of generated objects, we introduce geometric and\ntopological metrics based on sphericity, mean curvature, and Euler\ncharacteristic to provide richer structural insights.

This spot marketspace\nwas extended with spot blocks, and recently Amazon reworked the bidding\noptions. In addition, other cloud providers, such as Virtustream, adopt dynamic\ntrading mechanisms. The scientific community envisions autonomous multi-round\nnegotiations for realizing future cloud marketspaces. Consequently, consumers\nand providers exchange offers and counteroffers to reach an agreement.

Our framework incorporates a layered\narchitecture, where trust is dynamically established through endorsement-based\ncalculations and maintained via a hierarchical chain-of-trust mechanism.\nBlockchain serves as the Verifiable Data Registry, ensuring transparency and\nimmutability of identity operations, while smart contracts automate critical\nprocesses such as credential issuance, verification, and revocation. A\nproof-of-concept implementation demonstrates that the proposed framework is\nfeasible and incurs minimal overheads compared to the baseline, making it\nwell-suited for dynamic and resource-constrained IoT environments."}

To\nreduce bitrate dramatically while maintaining MLLM accuracy, we propose\nContext-Aware Video Streaming that recognizes the importance of each video\nregion for chat and allocates bitrate almost exclusively to chat-important\nregions. To avoid packet retransmission, we propose Loss-Resilient Adaptive\nFrame Rate that leverages previous frames to substitute for lost/delayed frames\nwhile avoiding bitrate waste. To evaluate the impact of video streaming quality\non MLLM accuracy, we build the first benchmark, named Degraded Video\nUnderstanding Benchmark (DeViBench). Finally, we discuss some open questions\nand ongoing solutions for AI Video Chat."}

Since generated source code\nis virtually impossible to distinguish from manually written code, their\nreal-world usage and impact on open-source software development remain poorly\nunderstood.

Using this concept as a lens to study\nhow GenAI tools are integrated into open-source software projects, we analyze a\ncurated sample of more than 250,000 GitHub repositories, identifying 1,292 such\nself-admissions across 156 repositories in commit messages, code comments, and\nproject documentation. Using a mixed methods approach, we derive a taxonomy of\n32 tasks, 10 content types, and 11 purposes associated with GenAI usage based\non 284 qualitatively coded mentions. We then analyze 13 documents with policies\nand usage guidelines for GenAI tools and conduct a developer survey to uncover\nthe ethical, legal, and practical concerns behind them. Our findings reveal\nthat developers actively manage how GenAI is used in their projects,\nhighlighting the need for project-level transparency, attribution, and quality\ncontrol practices in the new era of AI-assisted software development.

However, in\nsafety-critical applications, this learning process must not only be effective\nbut demonstrably safe.

We conduct a randomized controlled trial\n(RCT) to understand how AI tools at the February-June 2025 frontier affect the\nproductivity of experienced open-source developers. 16 developers with moderate\nAI experience complete 246 tasks in mature projects on which they have an\naverage of 5 years of prior experience. Each task is randomly assigned to allow\nor disallow usage of early 2025 AI tools. When AI tools are allowed, developers\nprimarily use Cursor Pro, a popular code editor, and Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet.\nBefore starting tasks, developers forecast that allowing AI will reduce\ncompletion time by 24%. After completing the study, developers estimate that\nallowing AI reduced completion time by 20%. Surprisingly, we find that allowing\nAI actually increases completion time by 19%--AI tooling slowed developers\ndown. This slowdown also contradicts predictions from experts in economics (39%\nshorter) and ML (38% shorter). To understand this result, we collect and\nevaluate evidence for 20 properties of our setting that a priori could\ncontribute to the observed slowdown effect--for example, the size and quality\nstandards of projects, or prior developer experience with AI tooling. Although\nthe influence of experimental artifacts cannot be entirely ruled out, the\nrobustness of the slowdown effect across our analyses suggests it is unlikely\nto primarily be a function of our experimental design."}

Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also\nserve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by\nother models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking\ndifferent LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.\nHowever, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its\neffectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of\ndedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a\nbenchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and\nunit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform\nnon-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even\nrelatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially\ntrained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still\nexhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise\njudging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can\nsubstantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests\nwritten by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in\nperformance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and\nconsistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal\nprompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise\ncomparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining\ncomments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved\njudge performance."}
