However, not all abstracts are as informative as\nthey could be. Objective: Characterize the structure of abstracts in\nhigh-quality software engineering venues. Observe and quantify deficiencies.\nSuggest guidelines for writing informative abstracts. Methods: Use qualitative\nopen coding to derive concepts that explain relevant properties of abstracts.\nIdentify the archetypical structure of abstracts. Use quantitative content\nanalysis to objectively characterize abstract structure of a sample of 362\nabstracts from five presumably high-quality venues. Use exploratory data\nanalysis to find recurring issues in abstracts. Compare the archetypical\nstructure to actual structures. Infer guidelines for producing informative\nabstracts. Results: Only 29% of the sampled abstracts are complete, i.e.,\nprovide background, objective, method, result, and conclusion information. For\nstructured abstracts, the ratio is twice as big. Only 4% of the abstracts are\nproper, i.e., they also have good readability (Flesch-Kincaid score) and have\nno informativeness gaps, understandability gaps, nor highly ambiguous\nsentences. Conclusions: (1) Even in top venues, a large majority of abstracts\nare far from ideal. (2) Structured abstracts tend to be better than\nunstructured ones. (3) Artifact-centric works need a different structured\nformat. (4) The community should start requiring conclusions that generalize,\nwhich currently are often missing in abstracts."}

To address this issue this study evaluates the\neffectiveness of Redundancy Mitigation (RM) for VRU Awareness Messages (VAM),\nfocusing specifically on cyclists. The objective of RM is to minimize the\ntransmission of redundant information. We conducted a simulation study using a\nurban scenario with a high bicycle density based on traffic data from Hannover,\nGermany. This study assessed the impact of RM on channel load, measured by\nChannel Busy Ratio (CBR), and safety, measured by VRU Perception Rate (VPR) in\nsimulation. To evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the RM mechanisms, we\nanalyzed the actual differences in position, speed, and heading between the ego\nVRU and the VRU, which was assumed to be redundant. Our findings indicate that\nwhile RM can reduce channel congestion, it also leads to a decrease in VPR.

To\naddress these limitations, we propose an adapted RM mechanism that improves the\nbalance between reducing channel load and maintaining VRU awareness.

Recent research has demonstrated that Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), with their exceptional general-purpose text analysis\nand code generation capabilities, can be effectively applied to certain telecom\nproblems (e.g., auto-configuration of data plan to meet certain application\nrequirements). However, due to their inherent token-by-token processing and\nlimited capacity for maintaining extended context, LLMs struggle to fulfill\ntelecom-specific requirements such as cross-layer dependency cascades (i.e.,\nover OSI), temporal-spatial fault correlation, and real-time distributed\ncoordination. In contrast, Large Concept Models (LCMs), which reason at the\nabstraction level of semantic concepts rather than individual lexical tokens,\noffer a fundamentally superior approach for addressing these telecom\nchallenges. By employing hyperbolic latent spaces for hierarchical\nrepresentation and encapsulating complex multi-layered network interactions\nwithin concise concept embeddings, LCMs overcome critical shortcomings of LLMs\nin terms of memory efficiency, cross-layer correlation, and native multimodal\nintegration.

Many\nestablished methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image\ndetail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize\nthe global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR\nshutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the\nsensor.

The growing interest in this challenge\nhighlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured\nenvironments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to\nenhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce\nan Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of\nmodeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination\nchanges, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and\nvehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed\nlow-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the\nego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention\nprediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to\n$\\mathbf{15\\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an\nincrease of up to $\\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets.\nAdditionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of\nintention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new\nchallenges for the pedestrian behavior research community to build robust\nmodels.
