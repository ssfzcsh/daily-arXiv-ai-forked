However, migrating existing monolithic systems to microservices is a\ncomplex and resource-intensive task, which can benefit from machine learning\n(ML) to automate some of its phases. Choosing the right ML approach for\nmigration remains challenging for practitioners. Previous works studied\nseparately the objectives, artifacts, techniques, tools, and benefits and\nchallenges of migrating monolithic systems to microservices. No work has yet\ninvestigated systematically existing ML approaches for this migration to\nunderstand the \\revised{automated migration phases}, inputs used, ML techniques\napplied, evaluation processes followed, and challenges encountered. We present\na systematic literature review (SLR) that aggregates, synthesises, and\ndiscusses the approaches and results of 81 primary studies (PSs) published\nbetween 2015 and 2024. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic\nReview and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement to report our findings and answer\nour research questions (RQs). We extract and analyse data from these PSs to\nanswer our RQs. We synthesise the findings in the form of a classification that\nshows the usage of ML techniques in migrating monolithic systems to\nmicroservices. The findings reveal that some phases of the migration process,\nsuch as monitoring and service identification, are well-studied, while others,\nlike packaging microservices, remain unexplored. Additionally, the findings\nhighlight key challenges, including limited data availability, scalability and\ncomplexity constraints, insufficient tool support, and the absence of\nstandardized benchmarking, emphasizing the need for more holistic solutions."}

Agent communications\nserve as a key to effective agent interactions in MAS and thus have a\nsignificant impact on the performance of agentic AI applications. The recent\nresearch on agent communications has made exciting rapid progress that leads to\na variety of protocol designs, among which the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol is\nconsidered the most representative one. Simultaneously, the rise of edge\nintelligence is expected to enable agentic AI at the network edge. However, the\ncurrent agent communication protocols are designed without sufficient\nconsideration of the special challenges of edge computing, and their\neffectiveness in the edge environment is largely unexamined. In this paper, we\nattempt to assess the abilities of agent communication technologies to face the\nchallenges of edge computing using the A2A protocol as a representative case.\nWe first discuss the core functionalities of agent communications, present a\nlandscape of agent communication protocols, and identify the main challenges\nintroduced by edge computing. Then, we conduct a case study on the A2A protocol\nto examine the key technologies leveraged in the protocol for their\neffectiveness in meeting the requirements of agent communications in edge\ncomputing. Based on the insights obtained from this assessment, we identify\nopen issues in the current agent communication technologies and discuss\ndirections for future research to address these issues."}

To\nmeet time-to-market demands while ensuring thorough chip verification, parallel\nacceleration of RTL fault simulation is necessary. Due to the dynamic nature of\nfault propagation paths and varying fault propagation capabilities, task loads\nin RTL fault simulation are highly imbalanced, making traditional\nsingledimension parallel methods, such as structural-level parallelism,\nineffective. Through an analysis of fault propagation paths and task loads, we\nidentify two types of tasks in RTL fault simulation: tasks that are few in\nnumber but high in load, and tasks that are numerous but low in load.

Evaluation experiments\nindicate that fragmenting data packets and retransmitting any missed fragments\ncan mitigate LoRa's inherent throughput and packet size limitations, although\nissues such as collisions and line-of-sight interference persist. An automated\nfailover mechanism was integrated into the architecture, enabling unresponsive\nservices to be redeployed to alternative nodes within one second, demonstrating\nthe system's resilience in maintaining operational continuity despite node or\nservice failures. The paper also identifies practical challenges, including the\nnecessity for time-slotting transmissions to prevent data packet overlap and\ncollisions. Future research should explore the integration of mesh networking\nto enhance range, develop more advanced scheduling algorithms, and adopt\ncutting-edge low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) techniques."}

However, while NLP and artificial intelligence (AI) research has\nextensively focused on tasks such as code generation, less attention has been\ngiven to automating support for the adoption of best practices, the evolution\nof ways of working, and the monitoring of process health. This study addresses\nthis gap by exploring the integration of Essence, a standard and thinking\nframework for managing software engineering practices, with large language\nmodels (LLMs). To this end, a specialised chatbot was developed to assist\nstudents and professionals in understanding and applying Essence. The chatbot\nemploys a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to retrieve relevant\ncontextual information from a curated knowledge base. Four different LLMs were\nused to create multiple chatbot configurations, each evaluated both as a base\nmodel and augmented with the RAG system. The system performance was evaluated\nthrough both the relevance of retrieved context and the quality of generated\nresponses. Comparative analysis against the general-purpose LLMs demonstrated\nthat the proposed system consistently outperforms its baseline counterpart in\ndomain-specific tasks. By facilitating access to structured software\nengineering knowledge, this work contributes to bridging the gap between\ntheoretical frameworks and practical application, potentially improving process\nmanagement and the adoption of software development practices.
