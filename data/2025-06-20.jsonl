While these systems are gaining popularity, their safety has been largely overlooked, despite the fact that evaluating and understanding their potential for harmful behavior is essential for widespread adoption. To address this gap, we introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use agents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test models across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt injection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150 tasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright infringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to interact with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser, etc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and safety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and 0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier models - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide insights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply with many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt injections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions. The OS-Harm benchmark is available at https://github.com/tml-epfl/os-harm."}

ACM Softw. Eng. 2, FSE", "summary": "Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation, data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz libraries.\n  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause, which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries. Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%, depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our manuscript."}

Traditional fuzzing evaluations typically focus on overall fuzzer performance across a set of target programs, yet few benchmarks consider how fine-grained program features influence fuzzing effectiveness.

We reviewed 25 recent grey-box fuzzing studies, extracting 7 program features related to control-flow and data-flow that can impact fuzzer performance. Using these features, we generated a benchmark consisting of 153 programs controlled by 10 fine-grained configurable parameters. We evaluated 11 popular fuzzers using this benchmark. The results indicate that fuzzer performance varies significantly based on the program features and their strengths, highlighting the importance of incorporating program characteristics into fuzzing evaluations."}

However, manually processing these reports is resource-intensive, leading to delays and potential loss of valuable insights. To address this challenge, enhancement report approval prediction (ERAP) has emerged as a research focus, leveraging machine learning techniques to automate decision-making. While traditional approaches have employed feature-based classifiers and deep learning models, recent advancements in large language models (LLM) present new opportunities for enhancing prediction accuracy. This study systematically evaluates 18 LLM variants (including BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa-v3, ELECTRA, and XLNet for encoder models; GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 3.1 8B Instruct and DeepSeek-V3 for decoder models) against traditional methods (CNN/LSTM-BERT/GloVe). Our experiments reveal two key insights: (1) Incorporating creator profiles increases unfine-tuned decoder-only models' overall accuracy by 10.8 percent though it may introduce bias; (2) LoRA fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B Instruct further improve performance, reaching 79 percent accuracy and significantly enhancing recall for approved reports (76.1 percent vs. LSTM-GLOVE's 64.1 percent), outperforming traditional methods by 5 percent under strict chronological evaluation and effectively addressing class imbalance issues. These findings establish LLM as a superior solution for ERAP, demonstrating their potential to streamline software maintenance workflows and improve decision-making in real-world development environments. We also investigated and summarized the ER cases where the large models underperformed, providing valuable directions for future research."}

These services utilize diverse programming languages and are distributed across various nodes as encapsulated containers. Given their vast scale, even minor performance enhancements can lead to significant cost reductions. In this paper, we introduce Atys1, an efficient profiling framework specifically designed to identify hotspot functions within large-scale distributed services. Atys presents four key features. First, it implements a language-agnostic adaptation mechanism for multilingual microservices. Second, a two-level aggregation method is introduced to provide a comprehensive overview of flamegraphs. Third, we propose a function selective pruning (FSP) strategy to enhance the efficiency of aggregating profiling results. Finally, we develop a frequency dynamic adjustment (FDA) scheme that dynamically modifies sampling frequency based on service status, effectively minimizing profiling cost while maintaining accuracy. Cluster-scale experiments on two benchmarks show that the FSP strategy achieves a 6.8% reduction in time with a mere 0.58% mean average percentage error (MAPE) in stack traces aggregation. Additionally, the FDA scheme ensures that the mean squared error (MSE) remains on par with that at high sampling rates, while achieving an 87.6% reduction in cost."}

However, the limited spatial resolution in 360° videos does not allow for each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360° video signals. An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360° video datasets for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360° Video Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models to 360° videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model for 360° Video Super-Resolution (360° VSR), called Spherical Signal Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360°~specific super-resolution models on 360° video datasets. A step-wise ablation study is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation."}

To address these gaps, we introduce SimBank: a simulator designed for accurate benchmarking of PresPM methods. Modeled after a bank's loan application process, SimBank enables extensive comparisons of both online and offline PresPM methods. It incorporates a variety of intervention optimization problems with differing levels of complexity and supports experiments on key causal machine learning challenges, such as assessing a method's robustness to confounding in data. SimBank additionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case, it can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not possible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel activities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely resemble real-life process instances. Our proof of concept demonstrates SimBank's benchmarking capabilities through experiments with various PresPM methods across different interventions, highlighting its value as a publicly available simulator for advancing research and practice in PresPM."}

We find that the resource demands of LLM applications can be modeled in a general and accurate manner with Probabilistic Demand Graph (PDGraph). We then propose Hermes, which leverages PDGraph for efficient serving of LLM applications. Confronting probabilistic demand description, Hermes applies the Gittins policy to determine the scheduling order that can minimize the average application completion time. It also uses the PDGraph model to help prewarm cold backends at proper moments.

The complexity of these incentive mechanisms, combined with their entanglement in low-level implementation details, makes it challenging to precisely assess the structural and economic properties of lending protocols, as well as to analyze user strategies and attacks. Crucially, since participation is open to anyone, any weaknesses in the incentive mechanism may give rise to unintended emergent behaviours, or even enable adversarial strategies aimed at making profits to the detriment of legit users, or at undermining the stability of the protocol.

We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance, offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that complements existing LLM serving infrastructures."}

Haskell provides parallel programming abstractions such as IVar and LVar in the Par monad and concurrent abstractions such as MVar and TVar in the in IO and STM monads, respectively.

Programming patterns that are both concurrent and determinate, such as those provided by Kahn or Berry require memory abstractions at a higher level than is currently available. In this paper we describe a new type context PSM for policy synchronised memory in Haskell. Like STM and IO, the computations in PSM can access persistent state and, as a side-effect, update the memory in imperative style. Like the Par and IO monads, PSM supports concurrent threads and shared state. However, in contrast to IO, our PSM contexts are race-free since concurrent accesses are policy coordinated which guarantees determinacy.Well-typed transactions in the PSM context can accommodate abstract data structures that are imperative, concurrently shareable and still behave deterministically, by construction."}

We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) integrated with a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning framework for improved interference coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static priorities, our approach dynamically learns link priorities based on real-time traffic demand, network topology, remaining transmission opportunities, and interference patterns. The GCN captures spatial dependencies, while the DQN enables adaptive scheduling decisions through reward-guided exploration. Simulation results show that our GCN-DQN model achieves mean SINR improvements of 179.6\\%, 197.4\\%, and 175.2\\% over LDP across three network configurations. Additionally, the GCN-DQN model demonstrates mean SINR improvements of 31.5\\%, 53.0\\%, and 84.7\\% over our previous CNN-based approach across the same configurations. These results underscore the effectiveness of our GCN-DQN model in addressing complex URLLC requirements with minimal overhead and superior network performance."}

Reference models, critical for accelerating the verification process, are themselves becoming more intricate and time-consuming to develop. Despite the promise shown by large language models (LLMs) in code programming, effectively generating complex reference models remains a significant hurdle. To address these challenges, we introduce ChatModel, the first LLM-aided agile reference model generation and verification platform. ChatModel streamlines the transition from design specifications to fully functional reference models by integrating design standardization and hierarchical agile modeling. Employing a building-block generation strategy, it not only enhances the design capabilities of LLMs for reference models but also significantly boosts verification efficiency. We evaluated ChatModel on 300 designs of varying complexity, demonstrating substantial improvements in both efficiency and quality of reference model generation. ChatModel achieved a peak performance improvement of 55.02% compared to alternative methods, with notable enhancements in generation stability, and delivered a 9.18x increase in its capacity to produce reference model designs. Furthermore, it accelerated the iterative process of reference model design and validation by an average of 5.90x compared to traditional approaches. These results highlight the potential of ChatModel to significantly advance the automation of reference model generation and validation."}

Since DMMs are fundamentally classical dynamical systems, their ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be efficiently simulated on modern computers. This provides a unique platform to study their performance under various conditions. An aspect that has received little attention so far is how their performance is affected by the numerical errors in the solution of their ODEs and the physical noise they would be naturally subject to if built in hardware. Here, we analyze these two aspects in detail by varying the integration time step (numerical noise) and adding stochastic perturbations (physical noise) into the equations of DMMs. We are particularly interested in understanding how noise induces a chaotic transition that marks the shift from successful problem-solving to failure in these systems. Our study includes an analysis of power spectra and Lyapunov exponents depending on the noise strength. The results reveal a correlation between the instance solvability and the sign of the ensemble averaged mean largest Lyapunov exponent. Interestingly, we find a regime in which DMMs with positive mean largest Lyapunov exponents still exhibit solvability. Furthermore, the power spectra provide additional information about our system by distinguishing between regular behavior (peaks) and chaotic behavior (broadband spectrum). Therefore, power spectra could be utilized to control whether a DMM operates in the optimal dynamical regime. Overall, we find that the qualitative effects of numerical and physical noise are mostly similar, despite their fundamentally different origin."}

Existing LLM caching techniques (like context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots, are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance, offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that complements existing LLM serving infrastructures."}

In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments. Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research."}

However, reasoning about concurrency is difficult, and unexpected races show up as bugs. Data race detection in shared memory systems is well-studied (dynamic data race detection [13], behavioral types [15], dynamic race detection [31]). Similar to how a data race consists of reads and writes not related by happens-before at a shared memory location, a communication race consists of receives and sends not related by happens-before on a shared channel. Communication races are problematic: a receiver expects a specific message from a specific sender, but with a communication race, the receiver can receive a message meant for another receiver, or not receive anything at all. In this work, we describe a verification framework that can prove the absence of communication races for distributed programs that use a subset of the Go programming language, where synchronization is mainly achieved via message passing.

This paper introduces a generic and comprehensive method to address these computational challenges. This method generates a small, size-tunable supplementary dataset that stores the cumulative sums along specific subset dimensions on top of the raw data. This minor addition unlocks rapid and cheap high-resolution large-region data analysis, making calculations over large numbers of data points feasible with small instances or even microservices in the cloud.

Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters.

This work addresses these two challenges by proposing a self-calibrated mixed-signal CIM accelerator SoC, fabricated in 22-nm FDSOI technology. The integration is facilitated by (1) the CIM architecture, combining the density and ease of SRAM-based weight storage with multi-bit computation using linear resistors, and (2) an open-source programming and testing strategy for CIM systems. The accuracy and reliability are enabled through an automated RISC-V controlled on-chip calibration, allowing us to improve the compute SNR by 25 to 45% across multiple columns to reach 18-24 dB. To showcase further integration possibilities, we show how our proof-of-concept SoC can be extended to recent high-density linear resistor technologies for enhanced computing performance."}

However, this advancement also introduces serious cybersecurity risks due to the use of complex and often opaque models, extensive interconnectivity, interoperability with third-party peripheral devices, Internet connectivity, and vulnerabilities in the underlying technologies. These factors contribute to a broad attack surface and make threat prevention, detection, and mitigation challenging. Given the highly safety-critical nature of these devices, a cyberattack on these devices can cause the ML models to mispredict, thereby posing significant safety risks to patients. Therefore, ensuring the security of these devices from the time of design is essential. This paper underscores the urgency of addressing the cybersecurity challenges in ML-enabled medical devices at the pre-market phase. We begin by analyzing publicly available data on device recalls and adverse events, and known vulnerabilities, to understand the threat landscape of AI/ML-enabled medical devices and their repercussions on patient safety. Building on this analysis, we introduce a suite of tools and techniques designed by us to assist security analysts in conducting comprehensive premarket risk assessments. Our work aims to empower manufacturers to embed cybersecurity as a core design principle in AI/ML-enabled medical devices, thereby making them safe for patients."}

These I/O libraries store the metadata such as data types and dimensionality along with the raw data in the same files. While these libraries are well-optimized for concurrent access to the raw data, they are designed neither to handle a large number of data objects efficiently nor to create different data objects independently by multiple processes, as they require applications to call data object creation APIs collectively with consistent metadata among all processes. Applications that process data gathered from remote sensors, such as particle collision experiments in high-energy physics, may generate data of different sizes from different sensors and desire to store them as separate data objects. For such applications, the I/O library's requirement on collective data object creation can become very expensive, as the cost of metadata consistency check increases with the metadata volume as well as the number of processes. To address this limitation, using PnetCDF as an experimental platform, we investigate solutions in this paper that abide the netCDF file format, as well as propose a new file header format that enables independent data object creation. The proposed file header consists of two sections, an index table and a list of metadata blocks. The index table contains the reference to the metadata blocks and each block stores metadata of objects that can be created collectively or independently. The new design achieves a scalable performance, cutting data object creation times by up to 582x when running on 4096 MPI processes to create 5,684,800 data objects in parallel. Additionally, the new method reduces the memory footprints, with each process requiring an amount of memory space inversely proportional to the number of processes."}

In this paper, we introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards. Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D reward signals.

We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with 1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage.

Second, the LLM correctly identified the majority of original descriptions as \"Example\" (79.75%), which is identical to our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared to the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of 0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9 indicate some irrelevance.

The key contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio, captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions."}

Serving these models requires careful memory management, as their memory usage includes static weights, dynamic activations, and key-value caches. While static weights are constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV caches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for efficient memory management. Modern LLM serving systems typically handle runtime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory management relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a page table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction. This virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory fragmentation. However, this dual-level approach fundamentally isolates runtime memory and KV cache management, resulting in suboptimal memory utilization under dynamic workloads, which can lead to a nearly 20% drop in throughput.\n  To address these limitations, we propose eLLM, an elastic memory management framework inspired by the classical memory ballooning mechanism in operating systems. The core components of eLLM include: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction, which decouples the virtual address space of tensors from the physical GPU memory, creating a unified and flexible memory pool; (2) an Elastic Memory Mechanism that dynamically adjusts memory allocation through runtime memory inflation and deflation, leveraging CPU memory as an extensible buffer; and (3) a Lightweight Scheduling Strategy employing SLO-aware policies to optimize memory utilization and effectively balance performance trade-offs under stringent SLO constraints. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that eLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems, 2.32x higher decoding throughput, and supporting 3x larger batch sizes for 128K-token inputs."}

We propose chunking via Abstract Syntax Trees (\\ourwork), a structure-aware method that recursively breaks large AST nodes into smaller chunks and merges sibling nodes while respecting size limits. This approach generates self-contained, semantically coherent units across programming languages and tasks, improving performance on diverse code generation tasks, e.g., boosting Recall@5 by 4.3 points on RepoEval retrieval and Pass@1 by 2.67 points on SWE-bench generation.

For example, identifying and engaging motivated collaborators who are willing to co-design and deploy AI based solutions in real-world settings is often difficult. Even when such partnerships are established, many AI4SI projects \"fail\" to progress beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and hence, are unable to transition to at-scale production-level solutions. Furthermore, the unique challenges faced by AI4SI researchers are not always fully recognized within the broader AI community, where such work is sometimes viewed as primarily applied and not aligning with the traditional criteria for novelty emphasized in core AI venues. This paper attempts to shine a light on the diverse challenges faced in AI4SI research by diagnosing a multitude of factors that prevent AI4SI partnerships from achieving real-world impact on the ground.

Unlike humans, whose moral reasoning integrates contextual trade-offs, value systems, and ethical theories, LLMs often rely on surface patterns, leading to biased decisions in morally and ethically complex scenarios. To address this gap, we present a value-grounded framework for evaluating and distilling structured moral reasoning in LLMs. We benchmark 12 open-source models across four moral datasets using a taxonomy of prompts grounded in value systems, ethical theories, and cognitive reasoning strategies. Our evaluation is guided by four questions: (1) Does reasoning improve LLM decision-making over direct prompting? (2) Which types of value/ethical frameworks most effectively guide LLM reasoning? (3) Which cognitive reasoning strategies lead to better moral performance? (4) Can small-sized LLMs acquire moral competence through distillation? We find that prompting with explicit moral structure consistently improves accuracy and coherence, with first-principles reasoning and Schwartz's + care-ethics scaffolds yielding the strongest gains. Furthermore, our supervised distillation approach transfers moral competence from large to small models without additional inference cost. Together, our results offer a scalable path toward interpretable and value-grounded models."}

Selecting optimal programming approaches for modern heterogeneous HPC architectures has become increasingly critical. We systematically analyze these models across multiple dimensions: architectural foundations, performance characteristics, domain-specific suitability, programming complexity, and recent advancements. We examine each model's strengths, weaknesses, and optimization techniques. Our investigation demonstrates that MPI excels in distributed memory environments with near-linear scalability for communication-intensive applications, but faces communication overhead challenges. OpenMP provides strong performance and usability in shared-memory systems and loop-centric tasks, though it is limited by shared memory contention. CUDA offers substantial performance gains for data-parallel GPU workloads, but is restricted to NVIDIA GPUs and requires specialized expertise. Performance evaluations across scientific simulations, machine learning, and data analytics reveal that hybrid approaches combining two or more models often yield optimal results in heterogeneous environments. The paper also discusses implementation challenges, optimization best practices, and emerging trends such as performance portability frameworks, task-based programming, and the convergence of HPC and Big Data.

After the model generates an interior design image, a post-processing module identifies the top ten materials present and pairs them with carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) values from a general materials dictionary. This approach allows designers to immediately evaluate environmental impacts and refine prompts accordingly. We evaluate the system through three user tests: (1) no mention of sustainability to the user prior to the prompting process with generative AI, (2) sustainability goals communicated to the user before prompting, and (3) sustainability goals communicated along with quantitative CO2e data included in the generative AI outputs. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that the introduction of sustainability metrics in the third test leads to more informed design decisions, however, it can also trigger decision fatigue and lower overall satisfaction. Nevertheless, the majority of participants reported incorporating sustainability principles into their workflows in the third test, underscoring the potential of integrated metrics to guide more ecologically responsible practices.

The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose, CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However, because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+ with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates (5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%. Both of our proposals can be run via our code available at: https://github.com/gensyn-ai/CheckFree."}

To address this gap, we developed Carey, a GPT-4o-based chatbot designed to provide informational and emotional support to AD/ADRD caregivers. Using Carey as a technology probe, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 family caregivers following scenario-driven interactions grounded in common caregiving stressors.

Instead, the data are typically generated by an \\emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively collaborated in the learning process.

Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity, time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and recanalisation outcome.\n  $\\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models. Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.\n  $\\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors, and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in stroke care."}

Unlike traditional AI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the challenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based, always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared sign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the MH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical evidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based interaction. This suggests a promising path toward symbiotic AI systems that learn with humans, rather than from them, by dynamically aligning perceptual experiences, opening a new venue for symbiotic AI alignment."}

Students identified challenges and developed solutions outlining their ideal features in GenAI tools, appropriate school use, and regulations. These centered around the problem spaces of combating bias & misinformation, tackling crime & plagiarism, preventing over-reliance on AI, and handling false accusations of academic dishonesty.

Human performance baselines are vital for the machine learning community, downstream users, and policymakers to interpret AI evaluations. Models are often claimed to achieve \"super-human\" performance, but existing baselining methods are neither sufficiently rigorous nor sufficiently well-documented to robustly measure and assess performance differences. Based on a meta-review of the measurement theory and AI evaluation literatures, we derive a framework with recommendations for designing, executing, and reporting human baselines. We synthesize our recommendations into a checklist that we use to systematically review 115 human baselines (studies) in foundation model evaluations and thus identify shortcomings in existing baselining methods; our checklist can also assist researchers in conducting human baselines and reporting results. We hope our work can advance more rigorous AI evaluation practices that can better serve both the research community and policymakers.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step, interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes."}

Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.

However, conventional annotation methods heavily rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation. Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks, proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring."}

ACM Softw. Eng. 2, FSE", "summary": "Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation, data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz libraries.\n  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause, which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries. Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%, depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our manuscript."}

Although social robots tend to be deployed with ``expressive'' joyful voices, they lack this long-term variation found in human speech. Foundation model text-to-speech systems are beginning to mimic the expressivity in human speech, but they are difficult to deploy offline on robots. We present EmojiVoice, a free, customizable text-to-speech (TTS) toolkit that allows social roboticists to build temporally variable, expressive speech on social robots. We introduce emoji-prompting to allow fine-grained control of expressivity on a phase level and use the lightweight Matcha-TTS backbone to generate speech in real-time. We explore three case studies: (1) a scripted conversation with a robot assistant, (2) a storytelling robot, and (3) an autonomous speech-to-speech interactive agent. We found that using varied emoji prompting improved the perception and expressivity of speech over a long period in a storytelling task, but expressive voice was not preferred in the assistant use case."}

Given that language is a verbal task, this gap may have severe consequences for the effectiveness of robots for language teaching tasks. We address this lack of L2 teaching robot voices through three contributions: 1. We address the need for a lightweight and expressive robot voice. Using a fine-tuned version of Matcha-TTS, we use emoji prompting to create an expressive voice that shows a range of expressivity over time. The voice can run in real time with limited compute resources. Through case studies, we found this voice more expressive, socially appropriate, and suitable for long periods of expressive speech, such as storytelling. 2. We explore how to adapt a robot's voice to physical and social ambient environments to deploy our voices in various locations. We found that increasing pitch and pitch rate in noisy and high-energy environments makes the robot's voice appear more appropriate and makes it seem more aware of its current environment. 3. We create an English TTS system with improved clarity for L2 listeners using known linguistic properties of vowels that are difficult for these listeners. We used a data-driven, perception-based approach to understand how L2 speakers use duration cues to interpret challenging words with minimal tense (long) and lax (short) vowels in English. We found that the duration of vowels strongly influences the perception for L2 listeners and created an \"L2 clarity mode\" for Matcha-TTS that applies a lengthening to tense vowels while leaving lax vowels unchanged. Our clarity mode was found to be more respectful, intelligible, and encouraging than base Matcha-TTS while reducing transcription errors in these challenging tense/lax minimal pairs."}

Through longitudinal analysis of 1.5 million trips from 258 drivers in the UK, we find that after dynamic pricing, pay has decreased, Uber's cut has increased, job allocation and pay is less predictable, inequality between drivers is increased, and drivers spend more time waiting for jobs.

Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments. Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research."}
