A primary weakness in Quilts is\ntheir depiction of skip links, links that do not simply connect to a succeeding\nlayer. Therefore in our first study, we compare Quilts using color-only,\ntext-only, and mixed (color and text) skip link depictions, finding that path\nfinding with the color-only depiction is significantly slower and less\naccurate, and that in certain cases, the mixed depiction offers an advantage\nover the text-only depiction.

To support larger KV caches, prior work extends GPU memory\nwith CPU memory via CPU-offloading. This involves swapping KV cache between GPU\nand CPU memory.

For automating the annotation of such reviews,\nthis paper introduces the annotation model, GRACE (GRU-based Attention with\nCBOW Embedding), using Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) with Continuous Bag of Words\n(CBOW) and Attention mechanism. Approximately 16000 user reviews from seven\npopular social media apps on Google Play Store, including Instagram, Facebook,\nWhatsApp, Snapchat, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook Lite, and Line were\nanalyzed. Two annotators manually labelled the reviews, achieving a Cohen's\nKappa value of 0.87, ensuring a labeled dataset with high inter-rater agreement\nfor training machine learning models.

While considerable progress\nhas been made in computing constant-radius offset surfaces, computing\nvariable-radius offset surfaces remains a challenging problem. In this paper,\nwe present OffsetCrust, a novel framework that efficiently addresses the\nvariable-radius offsetting problem by computing a power diagram. Let $R$ denote\nthe radius function defined on the base surface $S$. The power diagram is\nconstructed from contributing sites, consisting of carefully sampled base\npoints on $S$ and their corresponding off-surface points, displaced along\n$R$-dependent directions. In the constant-radius case only, these displacement\ndirections align exactly with the surface normals of $S$. Moreover, our method\nmitigates the misalignment issues commonly seen in crust-based approaches\nthrough a lightweight fine-tuning procedure.

Our DMA-based inter-NUMA communication further mitigates NUMA\neffects and MPI limitations in hybrid parallelism. Combining all the\ninnovations, MMStencil outperforms state-of-the-art libraries on Nvidia A100\nGPGPU by up to 2.1x. Moreover, the performance improvements translate directly\nto real-world HPC applications and enable RTM applications to yield 1.8x\nspeedup versus a highly optimized industrial Nvidia A100 GPGPU version.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u9635\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u9ad8\u9636\u6a21\u677f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SIMD\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u5355\u5143\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728Nvidia A100\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u77e9\u9635\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u6a21\u677f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u95e8\uff0c\u4f46\u9488\u5bf9\u4e09\u7ef4\u9ad8\u9636\u6a21\u677f\u548cHPC\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u6709\u5f85\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u591a\u6838CPU\u4e0a\u77e9\u9635\u5355\u5143\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7SIMD\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u5355\u5143\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u5e76\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u786c\u4ef6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u8de8NUMA\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "MMStencil\u5728Nvidia A100\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5e93\u5feb2.1\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645HPC\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.8\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e09\u7ef4\u9ad8\u9636\u6a21\u677f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645HPC\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

In contrast,\nmany real-world graphs are inherently dynamic, with evolving structures over\ntime through insertions, deletions, and modifications of vertices, edges, and\nattributes. Generating efficient and correctly synchronized code for such\ndynamic graph algorithms remains a significant challenge.\n  In this work, we introduce an abstraction scheme and runtime optimizations\nfor the efficient processing of morph algorithms. Specifically, given an\ninitial graph G and a set of updates $\\Delta$G involving edge insertions and\ndeletions, we express the dynamic processing logic through a DSL and\nautomatically generate parallel code targeting multicore, distributed, and\nmany-core environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by\napplying the DSL-generated code to ten large graphs with diverse\ncharacteristics and three widely used algorithms: Shortest Paths, PageRank, and\nTriangle Counting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u62bd\u8c61\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DSL\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u56fe\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u56fe\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u62bd\u8c61\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DSL\u8868\u8fbe\u52a8\u6001\u5904\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6838\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u548c\u591a\u6838\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5341\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u6027\u7684\u56fe\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u5e38\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u3001PageRank\u3001\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u8ba1\u6570\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Just-in-time vulnerability prediction (JIT-VP)\nis a proactive approach to identifying vulnerable commits and providing early\nwarnings about potential security risks.

To enable a reliable\nevaluation, we introduce a large-scale public dataset comprising over one\nmillion commits from FFmpeg and the Linux kernel. Our empirical analysis of\neight state-of-the-art JIT-VP techniques reveals a significant decline in\npredictive performance when applied to real-world conditions; for example, the\naverage PR-AUC on Linux drops 98\\% from 0.805 to 0.016. This discrepancy is\nmainly attributed to the severe class imbalance in real-world datasets, where\nvulnerability-introducing commits constitute only a small fraction of all\ncommits.\n  To mitigate this issue, we explore the effectiveness of widely adopted\ntechniques for handling dataset imbalance, including customized loss functions,\noversampling, and undersampling.

However, current\nsystolic-array-based accelerators face significant challenges when executing\nFlashAttention. Systolic arrays can only achieve high utilization for\nconsecutive and large matrix multiplications. In contrast, FlashAttention\nrequires frequently interleaved matrix multiplications and softmax operations.\n  The frequent data swaps between the systolic array and external vector units\nresult in low systolic array utilization. This is further exacerbated by the\nfact that softmax involves numerous non-matrix operations, which are not\nwell-suited for systolic arrays. Moreover, the concurrent execution of matrix\nmultiplication on systolic arrays and softmax on vector units leads to register\nfile and SRAM port contention, further degrading performance.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose FSA, an enhanced systolic array\narchitecture that enables the entire FlashAttention algorithm to run entirely\nwithin a single systolic array, eliminating the need for external vector units.\nAt the core of FSA is SystolicAttention, a novel scheduling algorithm that maps\nFlashAttention operations onto systolic arrays with fine-grained, element-wise\noverlap. This significantly improves array utilization while preserving the\noriginal floating-point operation order to maintain numerical stability.\n  We implement FSA in synthesizable RTL and evaluate its performance against\nstate-of-the-art commercial accelerators.

In particular, unconscious parental\nexpectations, termed ideal parent bias, can suppress children's emotional\nexpression and autonomy. This suppression, referred to as suppressed emotion,\noften stems from well-meaning but value-driven communication, which is\ndifficult to detect or address from outside the family. Focusing on these\nlatent dynamics, this study explores Large Language Model (LLM)-based support\nfor psychologically safe family communication. We constructed a Japanese\nparent-child dialogue corpus of 30 scenarios, each annotated with metadata on\nideal parent bias and suppressed emotion. Based on this corpus, we developed a\nRole-Playing LLM-based multi-agent dialogue support framework that analyzes\ndialogue and generates feedback. Specialized agents detect suppressed emotion,\ndescribe implicit ideal parent bias in parental speech, and infer contextual\nattributes such as the child's age and background. A meta-agent compiles these\noutputs into a structured report, which is then passed to five selected expert\nagents. These agents collaboratively generate empathetic and actionable\nfeedback through a structured four-step discussion process. Experiments show\nthat the system can detect categories of suppressed emotion with moderate\naccuracy and produce feedback rated highly in empathy and practicality.\nMoreover, simulated follow-up dialogues incorporating this feedback exhibited\nsigns of improved emotional expression and mutual understanding, suggesting the\nframework's potential in supporting positive transformation in family\ninteractions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u5bb6\u5ead\u5fc3\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u6c9f\u901a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u538b\u6291\u60c5\u7eea\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u5e38\u5ffd\u89c6\u5bb6\u5ead\u4e2d\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u5fc3\u7406\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7236\u6bcd\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u504f\u89c1\u4f1a\u538b\u6291\u5b69\u5b50\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u652f\u6301\u5bb6\u5ead\u6c9f\u901a\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b30\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65e5\u8bed\u4eb2\u5b50\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u6807\u6ce8\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u538b\u6291\u60c5\u7eea\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u9002\u5ea6\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u538b\u6291\u60c5\u7eea\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u5728\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0a\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u8bdd\u663e\u793a\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u6709\u6240\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u671b\u652f\u6301\u5bb6\u5ead\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5b8c\u5584\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Decidability of\nthe problem is open in general, with the most notable positive result being a\ndecision procedure for LRS of order at most 4.\n  In this paper we consider a bounded version of the Skolem Problem, in which\nthe input consists of an LRS $\\langle u_n \\rangle_{n=0}^\\infty$ and a bound $N\n\\in \\mathbb N$ (with all integers written in binary), and the task is to\ndetermine whether there exists $n\\in\\{0,\\ldots,N\\}$ such that $u_n=0$. We give\na randomised algorithm for this problem that, for all $d\\in \\mathbb N$, runs in\npolynomial time on the class of LRS of order at most $d$.

To address this\ncritical security issue, we propose MT4DP, a Data Poisoning Attack Detection\nFramework for DL-based Code Search Models via Metamorphic Testing. MT4DP\nintroduces a novel Semantically Equivalent Metamorphic Relation (SE-MR)\ndesigned to detect data poisoning attacks on DL-based code search models.\nSpecifically, MT4DP first identifies the high-frequency words from search\nqueries as potential poisoning targets and takes their corresponding queries as\nthe source queries. For each source query, MT4DP generates two semantically\nequivalent follow-up queries and retrieves its source ranking list. Then, each\nsource ranking list is re-ranked based on the semantic similarities between its\ncode snippets and the follow-up queries. Finally, variances between the source\nand re-ranked lists are calculated to reveal violations of the SE-MR and warn\nthe data poisoning attack. Experimental results demonstrate that MT4DP\nsignificantly enhances the detection of data poisoning attacks on DL-based code\nsearch models, outperforming the best baseline by 191% on average F1 score and\n265% on average precision.

However, research in this area is still fragmented across\ndifferent communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered\nframeworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the\nSemantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation\nobscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic\nunderstanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive\nevolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and\nthe MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations\nof earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To\nsystematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic\nfoundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery\nmechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing\nagent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent\nwhere others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift\nin the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic\nWeb) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model\n(LLM).

Each node\nsends a single message to the referee based on its 1-hop neighborhood in the\ngraph, and the referee must decide whether the graph is $k$-edge connected by\ntaking into account the received messages.\n  We present the first lower bound for deciding a graph connectivity problem in\nthis model with a deterministic algorithm. Concretely, we show that the worst\ncase message length is $\\Omega( k )$ bits for $k$-edge connectivity, for any\nsuper-constant $k = O(\\sqrt{n})$.

As this problem does not appear to be amenable to reductions to\nexisting hard problems such as set disjointness or indexing due to correlations\nbetween the inputs of the three players, we leverage results from\ncross-intersecting set families to prove the hardness of UniqueOverlap for\ndeterministic algorithms.

IoT devices typically collect data\nfrom various sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and energy meters. Much of\nthis data is temporal in nature. Traditionally, data from IoT devices is\ncentralized for analysis, but this approach introduces delays and increased\ncommunication costs. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective\nalternative, allowing for model training across distributed devices without the\nneed to centralize data. In many applications, such as smart home energy and\nenvironmental monitoring, the data collected by IoT devices across different\nlocations can exhibit significant variation in trends and seasonal patterns.\nAccurately forecasting such non-stationary, non-linear time-series data is\ncrucial for applications like energy consumption estimation and weather\nforecasting. However, these data variations can severely impact prediction\naccuracy. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) Investigating how\nnon-linear, non-stationary time-series data distributions, like generalized\nextreme value (gen-extreme) and log norm distributions, affect FL performance.\n(2) Analyzing how different detrending techniques for non-linear time-series\ndata influence the forecasting model's performance in a FL setup. We generated\nseveral synthetic time-series datasets using non-linear data distributions and\ntrained an LSTM-based forecasting model using both centralized and FL\napproaches.

To address this, we propose a framework that uses Large Language\nModels (LLMs) for ambiguity detection specifically designed for collaborative\nsurgical scenarios. Our method employs an ensemble of LLM evaluators, each\nconfigured with distinct prompting techniques to identify linguistic,\ncontextual, procedural, and critical ambiguities. A chain-of-thought evaluator\nis included to systematically analyze instruction structure for potential\nissues. Individual evaluator assessments are synthesized through conformal\nprediction, which yields non-conformity scores based on comparison to a labeled\ncalibration dataset. Evaluating Llama 3.2 11B and Gemma 3 12B, we observed\nclassification accuracy exceeding 60% in differentiating ambiguous from\nunambiguous surgical instructions.
