Level-5 automated driving\nsystems (ADSs) could reduce driver errors contributing to pedestrian accidents,\nthough effectiveness depends on clarity and understandability for other road\nusers. External human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) have been proposed to\nfacilitate pedestrian-ADS communication, though consensus on optimal eHMI\nfeatures remains unclear. In an online survey, 153 participants responded to\nroad-crossing scenarios involving level-5 ADSs, with and without eHMIs. With\neHMIs, pedestrians crossed earlier and more confidently, and reported\nsignificantly increased perceptions of safety, trust, and understanding when\ninteracting with level-5 ADSs. Visual eHMI features (including a text display\nand external speedometer) were ranked more necessary than auditory ones, though\nauditory cues received positive feedback.

Existing programming paradigms lack\ndirect support for these inherently fixed-point computations, leading to\ninefficient and error-prone implementations.\n  This white paper explores the potential of the FPOP paradigm, which offers a\nhigh-level abstraction that enables concise and expressive problem\nformulations.

Their architecture and data handling are geared\ntowards scalability, uninterrupted availability, and both personal and\ncollaborative revenue generation. Primarily, artificial intelligence algorithms\nare employed on stored user data for optimization and feeds. This has the\npotential to impact user safety, privacy, and security, even when metadata is\nused. A new decentralized data arrangement framework based on the Fractal-tree\nand L-Systems algorithm is proposed to mitigate some of the impacts of social\nmedia platforms.\n  Future work will focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of the new\ndecentralized framework by comparing its results against state-of-the-art\nsecurity methods currently used in databases. A cryptographic algorithm could\nalso be implemented for the framework, employing a new key generation for each\nbranch. This will strengthen database security; for example, if a user key is\nleaked, regenerating the key for each branch will keep the data secure by\napplying defense mechanisms in the proposed L-System-based tree framework."}

The study explores how Gen-AI can support\ndisciplinary learning when aligned with pedagogical intent.

To characterize system covertness, we derive\nclosed form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP), outage\nprobability (OP), and optimal detection threshold for the adversary. We\nformulate a non-convex joint beamforming optimization problem at the BS and RIS\nunder unit-modulus constraints to maximize the covert rate.

Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct\nservers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU\nidleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our\nempirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request\narrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel\ntraining. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for\nco-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix\nintegrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime\nscheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload\ncharacteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors\nand co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization\nand serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation\nshows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by\nup to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over\ntraditional separate setups.

In e-learning environments, learners often need to\nnavigate a complex information space on their own. This challenge is further\ncompounded in interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics, due to the varied\nprior knowledge and backgrounds. In this paper, we studied how GenAI influences\ninformation search in bioinformatics research: (1) How do interactions with a\nGenAI chatbot influence learner orienteering behaviors?; and (2) How do\nlearners identify information scent in GenAI chatbot responses? We adopted an\nautoethnographic approach to investigate these questions. GenAI was found to\nsupport orienteering once a learning plan was established, but it was\ncounterproductive prior to that. Moreover, traditionally value-rich information\nsources such as bullet points and related terms proved less effective when\napplied to GenAI responses. Information scents were primarily recognized\nthrough the presence or absence of prior knowledge of the domain. These\nfindings suggest that GenAI should be adopted into e-learning environments with\ncaution, particularly in interdisciplinary learning contexts."}

Recent advances in large language\nmodels (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple\nIMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents\ndifferent business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on\nmultiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes\nvarious IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two\nprimary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA\nobjectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in\nresource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we\npropose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich\nstructured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We\npartition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to\nfacilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning\nprocedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking\nphases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better\nadaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks.

However,\nsuch explanations, which focus on the internal mechanisms that lead to a\nspecific output, are often unsuitable for non-experts. To facilitate a\nhuman-centered perspective on AI explanations, agents need to focus on\nindividuals and their preferences as well as the context in which the\nexplanations are given. This paper proposes a personalized approach to\nexplanation, where the agent tailors the information provided to the user based\non what is most likely pertinent to them. We propose a model of the agent's\nworldview that also serves as a personal and dynamic memory of its previous\ninteractions with the same user, based on which the artificial agent can\nestimate what part of its knowledge is most likely new information to the user."}

The study evaluates this ability\nin four significant aspects, namely, creating a course syllabus, presenting\nselected material, answering student questions, and creating an assessment. It\nshows that even though the AI is strong in some important parts like\norganization and accuracy, there are still some human aspects that are far away\nfrom the current abilities of AI. There is still a hidden emotional part, even\nin science, that cannot be fulfilled by the AI in its current state. This paper\nsuggests some recommendations to integrate the human and AI potentials to\ncreate better outcomes in terms of reaching the target of creating a full\ncourse of mathematics, at a university level, as best as possible."}

This paper presents and validates a\ncoupled in-the-loop test environment that integrates a Cyclist-in-the Loop test\nbench with a Vehicle-in-the-Loop test bench via a virtual environment (VE)\ndeveloped in Unreal Engine 5. The setup enables closed-loop, bidirectional\ninteraction between a real human cyclist and a real automated vehicle under\nsafe and controllable conditions. The automated vehicle reacts to cyclist\ngestures via stimulated camera input, while the cyclist, riding a stationary\nbicycle, perceives and reacts to the vehicle in the VE in real time. Validation\nexperiments are conducted using a real automated shuttle bus with a\ntrack-and-follow function, performing three test maneuvers - straight-line\ndriving with stop, circular track driving, and double lane change - on a\nproving ground and in the coupled in-the-loop test environment. The performance\nis evaluated by comparing the resulting vehicle trajectories in both\nenvironments. Additionally, the introduced latencies of individual components\nin the test setup are measured. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the\napproach and highlight its strengths and limitations for realistic ADS\nevaluation."}

The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited\nconceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging\nparadigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define\nvibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and generative AI\nengage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural\nlanguage dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from\ndeterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we\nrefer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their\nconceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute.\nOur results show that vibe coding reconfigures cognitive work by redistributing\nepistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting the expertise in the\nsoftware development process away from traditional areas such as design or\ntechnical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key\nopportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage,\nalongside risks, such as black box codebases, responsibility gaps, and\necosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-,\ntechnology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future\ninvestigations of this paradigm."}
